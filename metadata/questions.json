Plate Heat Exchanger Control  \nThe PHE is the first stage of heating or cooling. \nIf the return air temperature is greater than the outside air/ inlet air temperature by [1]\u02daC then the \nPHE will be available to operate in heating mode, reclaiming heat (if it is required) from the return air. \nWhen the unit is in heating mode, and if it is available, then the PHE forms the first/second st age of \nheating and is sequenced with the reheat battery to attain the required setpoint. \nIf the return air temperature is less than the outside air temperature by [1]\u02daC  then the PHE will be \navailable to operate in cooling mode, discharging heat from the outside air into the return air path. \nThe control loops governing the heating and cooling valves operate on setpoints that are [0.5]\u02daC  above \nand below the calculated/fixed discharge setpoint to provide a zero energy band and prevent cycling \nbetween heating and cooling. \nCommissioned by:  Signature:  Date:  \nWitnessed by:  Signature:  Date:  \n \n2.6.3.6. Frost Protection \nFrost protection is activated when any zone temperature drops below [5] \u00b0C and will cease when the \nzone with the lowest temperature has risen above 14 \u00b0C or until the BMS signals a different mode in \nwhich the heating plant operates. \nThe low inside air temperature signal is independent of the outside air temperature and low primary \nheating return water temperature signals. \nCommissioned by:  Signature:  Date:  \nWitnessed by:  Signature:  Date:  \n \n2.6.3.7. Supply Air Temperature Control \nThe supply air duct mounted temperature sensor will modulate the heating and cooling coil control \nvalves to maintain a supply air setpoint of [18]\u00b0C.  \nAn auto-reset capillary frost protection stat is laced across the downstream side of the frost coil. This \nis to prevent freezing air from being drawn across the coil in the event of a heating or valve failure. It \nis set to 5\u02daC. \nIf activated the frost stat is interlocked with the supply enable circuit and will shut down the fans and \nclose the inlet dampers. The heating valve will be set to 100% open. \nThe BMS tracks the number of Frost Stat activations. If the Frost Stat activates [3] times then the BMS \nwill prevent the plant from re -starting. A critical alarm will be generated, and a software switch will \nhave to be used to reset the frost strategy once the operators have investigated the reason for the \nrepeated frost failures. \nCommissioned by:  Signature:  Date:  \nWitnessed by:  Signature:  Date:  \n \n  ",

Install the Room Controller to cover more lateral movement.\n2. Install a door sensor , the internal Room Controller occupancy logic works better with a door sensor . Once a motion is detected \nafter a door is opened, the room stays in occupied state until the door is opened again which put the Room Controller in stand-\nby mode and if there is a motion then it goes back in occupied mode. It is also recommended to disable the unoccupied mode, \nset the unoccupied time to 0, so there is only 2 modes in the Room Controller: stand-by and occupied for a stand-alone solution. \nPlease refer to the two(2) diagrams below for the Room Controller internal occupancy states transition.\n8000 with internal and/or external motion sensors\n8000 Occupancy State\nOccupiedStand-by\n8000 with door sensor, internal and/or external motion sensors\n8000 Occupancy State\nOccupiedStand-by\nDoor opened/closed & \ndoor closed for at least \n15 secs\nDoor opened/closed & \ndoor closed for at least \n15 secs\nDoor closed for at \nleast 15 secs & motion \ndetected \nDoor closed for at \nleast 15 secs & motion \ndetected \nIgnore stand-by time even \nif there is no motion \n(guest is sleeping)\nNo motion\nafter stand-by time\nNo motion\nafter stand-by time\nMotion detected\nMotion detected\nStand-by time\nMore aggressive energy savings logic but may cause bad guest \nexperience (when guest is sleeping or not moving)\n8000 with internal and/or external motion sensors\n8000 Occupancy State\nOccupiedStand-by\n8000 with door sensor, internal and/or external motion sensors\n8000 Occupancy State\nOccupiedStand-by\nDoor opened/closed & \ndoor closed for at least \n15 secs\nDoor opened/closed & \ndoor closed for at least \n15 secs\nDoor closed for at \nleast 15 secs & motion \ndetected \nDoor closed for at \nleast 15 secs & motion \ndetected \nIgnore stand-by time even \nif there is no motion \n(guest is sleeping)\nNo motion\nafter stand-by time\nNo motion\nafter stand-by time\nMotion detected\nMotion detected\nStand-by time\nGood energy savings logic and better guest experience even when the \nguest is sleeping or not moving",

When replacing \nsensors never seperate a sensing head from its PCB. The \nsensor will have been calibrated using this particular board \nand therefore will not function correctly with any other.\nElectrical Installation\nThe GS300Mc is a safety device designed to give audible \nalarms and automatically provide latched electrical isolation \nof associated gas safety shut off valves in the event of a gas \nleak or build up of toxic gases. \nThe sensors can be located up to 100m from the gas detector. \nCable size should be 1mm 2 CSA. If the sensor cables are \nrun separately in specific conduit it is not essential to use \nscreened cable but if the cables are routed through conduit \nor trunking containing other wiring the use of screened cable \nis advisable. The wiring should be performed by a qualified \nperson in accordance with current regulations. The plug-in \nterminal rail makes installation easy and quick. Do not mount \nclose to any heat source or in an area where moisture is \nlikely to effect operation. The IP rating of this unit is IP44. \nSensors should be positioned as shown below. \nIf you require any guidance on this please call Duomo \ntechnical support on +44 1905 797989.\nImportant Notes\nAlways check the wiring before powering up the system. \nDo not test this sensor with anything other than Duomo \ntest gas (See 'GS300Mc Operation' section for further \ninformation). Concentrations above this will damage the \nsensor and shorten sensor life. \nThe installation of this gas detector does not release \nthe user from observing all the regulations concerning \nthe characteristics of the installation and the use \nof gas appliances; the ventilation of the protected \nenvironment and the removal of products of combustion.  \nDuomo will not be held responsible or liable for any damage \ncaused to people, property or animals resulting from incorrect \nconnection, installation or application of this gas detector.

        "context": "2 Kamstrup A/S \u2022 58101516_F1_GB_07.2019\nMULTICAL\u00ae 603\nDescription\nMULTICAL\u00ae 603 is an all-round calculator, suitable as heat \nmeter, cooling meter or combined heat/cooling meter \ntogether with 1 or 2 flow sensors and 2 or 3 temperature \nsensors. The meter is intended for energy measurement \nin almost all types of thermal installations where water is \nused as the energy-conveying medium.\nMULTICAL\u00ae 603 can, in addition to heat and cooling \nmeasurement, be used for leakage monitoring, permanent \nperformance monitoring, as power and flow limiter with \nvalve control as well as for energy measurement in both \nopen and closed systems. \nAccording to EN 1434 and MID, MULTICAL\u00ae 603 can be \ndesignated as a \u201dcalculator\u201d with separate type approval \nand verification, and it can be delivered either as a separate \ncalculator or as a complete meter, with mounted tem-\nperature sensors and flow sensor according to customer \nrequirements.\nMULTICAL\u00ae 603 has 2 flow sensor inputs that can be used \nfor both electronic and mechanical flow sensors. The pulse \nfigure can be programmed from 0.001 to 300 pulses/liter, \nand the calculator can be programmed to all nominal flow \nsensor sizes from 0.6 to 15,000 m\u00b3/h. The calculator can be \ndelivered with both galvanically connected and separated \nflow sensor inputs.\nThe accumulated heat energy and/or cooling energy can be \ndisplayed in kWh, MWh, GJ or Gcal, all in the form of seven \nor eight significant digits plus measuring unit. The display \nhas been specially designed with a view to obtaining long \nlifetime and sharp contrast in a wide temperature range. \nFurthermore, MULTICAL\u00ae 603 can be delivered in a variant \nwith backlit display (type 603-F).\nMULTICAL\u00ae 603 is powered by an internal D-cell lithium \nbattery with a lifespan of up to 16 years or a 2xAA lithium \npacket with a lifespan of up to 9 years. Alternatively, the \nmeter can be mains supplied, either by 24 VAC or 230 VAC.\nIn designing MULTICAL\u00ae 603, great importance has been \nattached to flexibility through programmable functions \nand plug-in modules in order to secure optimum use in a \nwide range of applications. The meter has been configured \nfrom the factory and is ready for use. It can, however, be \nchanged/reconfigured after installation via the front keys \nof the meter, READy or METERTOOL HCW.\nAuto Detect enables the exchange of ULTRAFLOW\u00ae X4 \non MULTICAL\u00ae 603 without the need for reconfiguration \n(change of the CCC code). MULTICAL\u00ae 603 can automati-\ncally adjust the pulse figure and qp to match the connected \nULTRAFLOW\u00ae X4 via Auto Detect. Auto Detect is active with \nCCC code 8xx and is initiated when the calculator top and \nbase are separated and reassembled.\nContents\nDescription 2\nMechanical construction  3\nMechanical data 3\nApproved meter data 4\nMeasurement accuracy 4\nDimensioned sketches 5\nElectrical data 6\nProduct variants 8\nMeter configuration 10\nInformation code types in display 11\nAccessories 12",

        "question": "What is the default behavior of the Modbus gateway regarding unit IDs in Modbus TCP/IP requests?",
        "answer": "By default, the Modbus gateway uses the unit ID in the Modbus TCP/IP request as the unit ID/server ID of the physical Modbus-SL device.",
        "context": "EcoStruxure Panel Server Modbus Gateway Function\nModbus Gateway Function\nPresentation\nThe EcoStruxure Panel Server implements a Modbus gateway function. It can\nserve requests received from up to 64 Modbus TCP/IP clients connected\nupstream so that each client can access data simultaneously from downstream\ndevices connected either via IEEE 802.15.4 wireless network or Modbus-SL wired\nnetwork.\nThe Modbus protocol exchanges information using a request-reply mechanism\nbetween a master (client) and a slave (server). The master-slave principle is a\nmodel for a communication protocol in which one device (the master) controls one\nor more other devices (the slaves). Modbus client ID was formerly known as\nMaster and Modbus server ID was formerly known as Slave.\nA vailability\nThis function is available on Panel Server Universal and Advanced.\nModbus Gateway Function\nThe Panel Server implements its own Modbus registers that are available at unit\nID 255, to provide its own identification information. Therefore, Panel Server has\nits own register table (see DOCA0241EN EcoStruxure Panel Server - Modbus\nRegisters File).\nThe Panel Server acts as a transparent Modbus-SL to Modbus TCP/IP gateway . It\nconverts Modbus TCP/IP requests received on unit ID X to Modbus-SL requests\nsent on server ID X. Responses obtained from the downstream devices are then\nforwarded upstream to the Modbus TCP/IP client.\nBy default, out-of-the-box, the Modbus gateway uses the unit ID in the Modbus\nTCP/IP request as unit ID / Server ID of the physical Modbus-SL device.\nFor Modbus TCP/IP devices, when carrying out commissioning, a virtual server ID\nis added to a Modbus TCP/IP device to allow access in case of separate topology\nor to enable the Modbus TCP proxy feature.\nThe Panel Server implements a set of virtual Modbus register tables per paired\nIEEE 802.15.4 wireless device. Each time a new wireless device is paired to the\nPanel Server, the device is automatically assigned a virtual Modbus server ID.\nThe first paired wireless device is assigned virtual server ID 100. Each\nsubsequent wireless device takes the next virtual ID, which gets automatically\nincremented by one each time a new device is paired. For detailed information\nabout the registers of supported wireless devices, refer to spreadsheet\nDOCA0241EN EcoStruxure Panel Server - Modbus Registers File.\nT o avoid conflicts between the server IDs of the physical Modbus-SL devices and\nthe virtual server IDs of the wireless devices, it is possible to update the virtual\nserver ID through EcoStruxure Power Commission software or the Panel Server\nwebpages (select Settings > Wireless devices then choose one connected\ndevice and change value in Modbus virtual > V irtual server ID).\nNOTE: The Modbus gateway function should not be confused with a network\ngateway or a router . The Panel Server does no routing and no forwarding at\nthe network (IP) layer .\nDefinitions of Modbus Unit ID / Server ID and V irtual Server ID\nT o enable an external Modbus TCP/IP client to access a device connected to the\nPanel Server, each device must have a unique ID named virtual server ID.\nThe virtual server ID is automatically assigned:\n52 DOCA0172EN-04",

Task Information Delivery Plan (TIDP) \nFurther the production of the first preliminary issue of post-contract BEP and appendices, each Task Team \nManager shall compile their own TIDP identifying their information deliverables aligned to milestone dates required \nto meet the project design and construction programme. \n\u2022 TIDPs are to include all of the Task Team\u2019s information deliverables (not just models and drawings). \n\u2022 TIPDs will sit alongside the post-contract BEP and will be shared to the CDE and updated iteratively as \nrequired via formal revisions. \n4.4. Master Information Delivery Plan (MIDP)  \nThe MIDP is the primary plan detailing all information deliverables for the project constituting the Project Information \nModel (PIM).  It identifies who is responsible for producing information and when that information is required aligned \nto the milestones detailed in the design and construction programme. \nThe MIDP is developed by Kier and references the TIDPs produced by each Consultant, Subcontractor and \nSpecialist Designer Task Team. The MIDP will be shared to the CDE and updated via formal revisions. \n \nNote: Kier\u2019s Information Required Schedule (IRS) will be used to fulfil the requirement for a MIDP in place of using \nthe formal MIDP template and will be uploaded to the CDE. \n  ",

If not, then, the first available virtual\nserver ID in the range 1\u2013247 will be assigned starting from virtual server ID 1.\n\u2022 For wireless devices, the first available virtual server ID in the range 1\u2013247\nwill be given starting from virtual server ID 100.\n\u2022 For Modbus TCP/IP devices, the first available virtual server ID in the range\n1\u2013247 will be given starting from virtual server ID 200.\nIMPORT ANT : It is recommended to set the Modbus physical address of\nModbus-SL devices in the range 1\u201399.\nFollowing this recommendation, in most configurations with less than 100\nModbus-SL devices, less than 100 wireless devices, and less than 48 Modbus\nTCP/IP devices, the virtual server ID will automatically be given as follows:\n\u2022 Modbus-SL devices will have their physical server ID assigned as virtual\nserver ID in the range 1\u201399.\n\u2022 V irtual server ID of wireless devices will be in the range 100\u2013199.\n\u2022 V irtual server ID of Modbus TCP/IP devices will be in the range 200\u2013247.\nThe virtual server ID can be changed using EcoStruxure Power Commission\nsoftware or in the Panel Server webpages (see Modbus Discovery settings,\npage 51). The virtual server ID must be unique.\nEcoStruxure Power Commission software and the Panel Server webpages\nprovide the following information for each device (see addition of Modbus devices,\npage 106):\n\u2022 V irtual server ID\n\u2022 Connection:\n\u25e6 Unit ID / server ID for Modbus-SL devices\n\u25e6 IP address for remote devices and unit ID / server ID for Modbus TCP/IP\ndevices\n\u25e6 RFID for wireless devices\n\u2022 Device type as defined in the device settings\nFor information about how to manage virtual server ID conflict, see Example of\nModbus Server ID Conflict and Resolution, page 53.\nFor examples how to use virtual server ID to access data in downstream devices\naccording to the communication architecture, see Examples of Modbus Routing,\npage 55.\nModbus Server ID Conflict and Resolution\nWith the above discovery and addition mechanism, the Panel Server will always\nassign an available and unique virtual server to every device.\nWhen carrying out commissioning, it is however possible to assign the same\nvirtual server ID to two devices.\nT o resolve this situation, update the virtual server ID in one of the two devices to\nan available server ID.\nDOCA0172EN-04 53",

        "question": "What is the recommended maximum lifespan of the ELEKTROGAS valve before replacement?",
        "answer": "10 years from the date of manufacture, although heavy cycle operation may reduce this.",
        "context": "ELEKTROGAS \u2013 Technical Sheet  EE161 - 1020 \n 10-11  \n \n \nDesign, \ninstallation \nand servicing To assure a proper and safe operation, as well as a long service life of the valve, consider the \nfollowing recommendations during the design of the system where the valve will be installed: \n \n \n \n  \n \n\u2713 Ensure that all the features of your system comply with the specifications of the valve (gas \ntype, operating pressure, flow rate, ambient temperature, electrical voltage, etc.). \n\u2713 Valve may be mounted with coil in horizontal or vertical position, not upside down. Coil may \nbe oriented 360 degrees in any direction. \n\u2713 In the event of vertical pipe, the flow direction should be from bottom to top. \n\u2713 After removing the end caps m ake sure no foreign body will enter into the valve d uring \nhandling or installation (e.g. swarf or excessive sealing agent).  \n\u2713 A gas filter should be always installed upstream the valve. \n\u2713 Ensure that installing area is protected from rain and water splashes or drops. \n\u2713 Perform leak and functional tests after mounting. \n\u2713 The continuous  service (100% ED) causes inevitable coil heating, depending on working \nenvironment. Never install the valve close to walls or o ther equipments. To improve the coil \ncooling, install the valve allowing free air circulation. \n\u2713 Perform maintenance according to service instructions at least once a year (most often for \naggressive gases). \n\u2713 Due to seals aging, to ensure safe operation, we re commend the valve repl acement after \n10 years from the d ate of manufacture stamped on the product.  The heavy cycle operation \nmay reduce the expected lifetime. \n\u2713 This control must be installed in compliance with the rules in force. \n\u2713 Make sure all works are perf ormed by qualified tec hnicians only and in compliance w ith \nlocal and national codes. \n\u2713 To prevent product dam age and dangerous sit uations, read carefully the i nstructions \nsupplied with the product before use. \n \n \n \nFor more details see the Installation and Service Instructions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

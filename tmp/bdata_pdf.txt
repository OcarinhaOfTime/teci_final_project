1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 General 
 
We trust that you are sati sfied with your new Building. We have produced this Building User 
Guide (See *Note) to provide you wit h easy-to-follow technical information to enable you to 
utilise it to an acceptable standard. 
 
Your Building User Guide contains important technical information relating to the  building. 
This includes information on the b uildings he ating and cool ing services, emergency 
information, and the buildings material and waste policies etc. 
 
We would bring to your attention that, throughout the life of the Building  this Building User 
Guide should be updated as necessary to incorpor ate any changes to the building’s 
information or policies etc. 
 
It is advisable that you make the Building Gui de available to all building users, stakeholders 
who may occupy the building a nd members of the Facilities Management Team. Should the 
Building be leased out or sold on, the information should be passed to the new  
occupiers. 
 
Ensuring that this Building Gui de is kept in a secure environment and ac cess to it is 
controlled, is vital, the information within it is unique to your Building.

1.2 How to Use Your Building User Guide 
 
Why do I need the 
Building User Guide?  
The Building User Guide  provides you with easy-to-follow 
technical information on aspects of your Building, what 
features the building contains  and how to utilise them 
correctly. It is a u nique reference document and as such it s 
reproduction will be very difficult, if not impossible, if it is lost. 
 
What does it look like?  Your Building User Guide  contains easy to f ollow technical 
information on your Buildi ng. It is handed over to you by the 
Principal Contractor on completion of the building or by your 
Landlord when you first occupy the Building. 
 
How long do I keep it?  The Building User Guide should be kept for th e lifetime of the 
building. 
 
Where should I keep it? 
 
The Building User Guide should be kept in a safe place in the 
building. I f a second copy has been provided this sh ould be 
kept at a different location. 
 
Who should look after 
it?  
You should appoint a ‘responsible person’ to control access to 
the Guide and ensuring tha t all copies are  updated. Y our 
Building Manager would normally undertake such a role. 
 
Who will be required to 
see it? 
 
Any building user or stakeholder that will occupy the building  
You should o nly allo w copies of the Guide to be taken; it 
should not leave the building. 
 
How is it updated? 
 
Your responsible  person should ensur e t hat the relevant 
procedures are followed. 
 
What if I sell or lease the 
Building to someone 
else? 
 
All copies of the Building User Guide should be passed to the 
new owner. However, if you retain  ownership, you should 
retain one copy and pass a copy to the leaser ensuring that a 
responsibility is given to t hem to update all copies of the 
Building User Guide. 
 
 
After re ading these questions and answers if you remain unsure of any as pect of your 
Building User Guide, Professional guidance should be sought fr om Kier Construction who 
will be able to provide you with advice and assistance.

Door contacts and a local internal sounder adjacent each door, to all external exit d oors, 
including fire es cape doors th at are not normally to  be utilised as an entrance/exit. Door 
contacts to all doors wi th Access control installed, this will allow the Trust to identify a door 
that has been forced open. Any door that is left open for longer than 45 seconds will sound a 
local alarm.  
 
The system is monitored on-site at the main entrance / RUH Trust switchboard. The syste m 
is not connected to a remote monitoring facility. 
 
The system is suitably zoned and each zone is separately activated/de -activated by local 
alarm keypads incorporating visual display and fobs. 
 
Keypads are provided at Main Reception and within Nuclear Medicine.  
 
Doors t hat are not normally in use, including fire escape doors are zoned so that the 
contacts and sounders on those doors can be active during the working day. If these doors 
are opened during the day this indicates on the panel at the Main Reception and actives the 
local sounder. The sounders are only able to be reset from the main reception desk. Under 
fire conditions the sounders are disabled so that their audible tone does not interfere with 
that of the fire alarm system.

mounted indicator lamps are installed. These lamps provide visual indication in a "follow-the-
light" arrangement, showing the location from which, the call originated. 
 
Each lamp serves as visual notification for patient calls, staff calls, and when a hand set i s 
removed from patient stations. Patient calls activate the lamp in a stead y mode, while 
emergency calls make the lamp flash. 
 
 
 
Over door lights with LEDs 
 
Patient Nurse Call Units  
The push button units are placed within easy reach of the patient, integrated into the bedside 
console. They are designed to be easily identifiable and accessible, featuring large buttons 
with clear labels or symbols. 
 
When a patient presses  the button, i t sends a  signal to the nurse call system, which alerts 
the nursing staff that assistance is needed. The system may trigger an audible alert, such as 
a tone or chime, and display the patient's location o n a central monitoring stat ion or 
individual staff devices.  
 
A fault monitoring system is provided for each nurse call system so that in the event of the 
hand unit plug being accidently removed, a call is initiated on the associated staff indicator.

Water (LTHW) from steam-to-LTHW plate heat exchangers located in Level 1 Heating & Hot 
Water Plantroom (64.1.040). 
 
The LTHW is produced via 2 No. duty/standby packaged plate heat exchangers generated 
via steam. The plate heat exchangers are rated to 1460kW. This is contr olled through the 
operation of individual motorized control va lves, ensuring that only one plate is open to the 
system at any one time.  
 
 
  
 
Plate heat exchangers 
 
Heating plant room 
 
The plate heat exchangers are connected to a pumped primary LTHW circuit and connect to 
a 300Ø low loss header.

primary flow and return pipework. 
 
A combined dirt and air separator is installed with chemical dosing pot etc. to remove any air 
and dissol ved gases that may get into the system from time to time, as a resu lt o f 
maintenance activities and also to remove a ny larger particulate dirt that may develop over 
the systems life. The dosing pot allows for correction of LTHW system water treatment levels 
without needing to shut the system down. 
 
The constant temperature LTHW circuit for the Cancer Centre building is  designed to 
operate on a flow tempe rature of 82°C with a return of 62°C where it then reheated through 
the system.  
 
Each pumped circuit on the heating primary systems consists of two independent circulating 
pumps with inverter-controlled motors. The pumps , are each capable of the full circuit flow 
rate and operate on a  ‘run and standby’ basis with automatic change-over and duty rotation 
provided by th e BMS system. This provides continued operation of the system in the event 
of a motor or other pump component failure.

make the system complete and fully function ing. The send and receive outstations are wall 
mounted and contained in a room w ith lockable doors or were located within the corridor of 
the Inpatient Ward the outstation has a lockable basket for added security.  
 
The systems gradually accelerate and then slo w down the c arrier on a rrival at the 
destination station. Where the tube connection to a send and receive  station is from above, 
carrier deceleration on arrival at the destination station is carried out using the 'air column 
technique'.  
 
Tubing has been installed from the agreed interface point from the underground service duct 
to the termination location within the First Floor Heating and  Hot Water Plan troom. The 
‘point-to-point’ tubing has capped ends and installed such that it can be connected to the site 
wide infrastructure and send and receive future outstation requirements.

The controller registers only one call from both the  car and the landi ngs. The first call 
registered has the absolute priority and it is executed in direct travel. 
 
Down Collective 
The controller registers every call from both the car and the landings. During the upward 
direction the landing calls are i gnored and only the car calls are executed in their natural 
sequence. During the downward direction the landing calls are also served.  
 
Full Selective Collective  
The controller registers every activated call from both the car and the landings. The landing 
calls are separated in up and down, activated by the respective push buttons in the L.O.P.s. 
During each travel the lift serves the car calls in their natural sequence and the landing calls 
of the same direction.  
 
Group Control  
The group control is use d when there is a need for central management of two or more lifts 
landing calls. This function optimizes the way that landing calls are distributed and served.  
 
Overload Control  
The overload function is activated when the load of the car exceeds the predefi ned limit. In 
that case the lift remains in the landing with the doors open until the load goes back to 
acceptable values. At the  same time the passengers are informed by acoustic and optical 
signals. 
 
Extra control options  
 
Fire Emergency  
The fire emergency can be activated either by a fire detector or a key switch located on the 
main floor. When activated, the lift travels immediately to the fire recall floor. The car remains 
there with open doors.

The firemen mode is activated by a key switch located in the main landing. The lift travels 
immediately to the fire recall floor where it remains with open doors. The f iremen can enter 
the car and operate the lift by turning on the key switch located in the C.O.P.  
 
Full Load Control  
When the car’s load exceeds the pre -set value, the lift serves only car calls and ignores the 
landing calls. In case of group the landing calls are served by another lift.  
 
Independent Control  
The function is activated by a key switch located in the C.O.P. The li ft ignores the lan ding 
calls and serves only the car calls.

3.0 SAFETY AND EMERGENCY INFORMATION / INSTRUCTIONS 
 
3.1 Fire Emergency 
 
This section is in no way related to or to int erfere with "Standing Orders" that exist for the 
evacuation of the buildings in respect of an emergency situati on such as fire, gas leak etc., 
but is does give an indication to the Buildings Services Engineers as to general safety 
measures to follow.  
 
By general agreement an Emergency Condition is defined as one which places at risk the 
safety of personnel or -creates a hazard to the Building or Plant.  
 
The Building and the Plant have been designed and constru cted in accordance with 
Statutory Regulations, Local By-Laws, and British Standard Codes of Practice.  Provided the 
plant is operated and maintained in accor dance with the re commendations issued b y the 
various manufacturers, the likelihood of an Emergency Condition arising is minimal.  
 
It is strongly recommended that personnel operating or involved with running this installation 
make themselves aware of the locati on of all Is olation and emergency "Knock Off" buttons 
as speed of action will minimise property destruction and could save lives.  
 
The most  important single precaution against a serious hazard is the action of approved 
operating and maintenance procedures.  
 
If an Em ergency Condition should appear, it is most likely to be within one of the following 
categories: 
 
a) Fire or explosion caused by a gas leak. 
b) Electrical fire caused by severe short circuit or insulation breakdown. 
c) Explosion in boiler combustion chamber caused by malfunction of the safety controls. 
d) Flooding of an area caused by rupture of a pipe or joint. 
 
The new Cancer Centre will be evacuated in a phased horizontal manner as detailed in the 
fire strategy and building Cause & Effect. 
 
Gas Leak 
 
If a gas leak is suspected, or detected, proceed as follows: 
 
1. Close the nearest manual isolation valve or operate the emergency knock off button. 
2. Extinguish any ignition sources present (e.g. naked lights or fires, welding apparat us 
etc.) 
3. Shut down any adjacent electrical apparatus to the area where gas is detected. This 
should be done from a location external to the gas leak. 
4. Open adjacent doors and windows to provide maximum ventilation. 
5. Advise the local Gas Authority's Emergency Service. 
6. Consult the local Fire officer before restarting plant. 
 
Electrical Fires 
 
Cleanliness of equipment, adequate ventilation, protection fro m water and dampness and 
gas or petrol fumes, correct adjustment of overload protection from devices and the fitting of 
fuses of the correct rating are generally accepted as good practice and the most satisfactory 
methods of avoiding electrical fires.  Another obvious precaution  is to not overload an 
electrical circuit in the first instance.  
BUILDING USER GUIDE – TECHNICAL USER 
Royal United Hospitals, Dyson Cancer Centre, Bath 
© 2023 Riddell Project Management – Rev 2 (09.02.24) 
3.1 Emergency Conditions – Continued  
 
If an electrical fire occurs, proceed as follows: 
 
• Isolate the supply (or supplies) at the nearest distribution board or switchgear. 
• Use CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) hand fire extinguishers to fight the fire. 
 
NOTE: If the CO2 extinguishers fail to extinguish the fire, use dry powder extinguishers as a 
back-up. 
 
Boiler Explosion 
 
Rupture of the boiler shell is extremely unlikely, but instances have occurred of an explosion 
in the combustion chamber. The burner programmer is designed to purge the combustion 
chamber free of gas before ignition occurs, and to i gnite the pilot jet before the main jet.  If 
the combustion chamber were to be fille d with a gas/air mixture when the igniter began 
sparking, a serious explosion could occur.  
 
Instances are re corded of burner safe ty c ontrols being "adju sted" by unaut horised 
personnel. ONLY QUALIFIED personnel who have attended a course of instruction 
approved by the burner manufacturer should attempt to carry out this work. 
 
NOTE: All burner manufacturers offer courses of instructi on for operating and ma intenance 
personnel. 
 
If an explosion were to occur in the Boiler Room, proceed as follows:  
 
1. Shut off main gas incoming supply. 
2. Shut off all electrical supplies at the nearest switchgear control cubicle. 
3. As soon  as possible (and if possible) cl ose the mai n distribution heating flow and 
return header branch circuit isolating valves to primary and scheduled circuits, to 
reduce flooding. 
4. Close the main heating pressurisation unit system isolation valve. Turn local 
pressurisation unit isolator to its OFF position. 
5. Evacuate the building and all adjacent areas of personnel. 
 
Flooding 
 
If a cold-water pipe ruptures, or a serious leak develops, close the isolating valve nearest the 
leak.  If necessary, close the main isolation valve on the incoming main in the plantroom.  
 
Note: Leave the incoming fire main isolating valve in its open position.  
 
If a low -pressure hot water heating pipe/ joint ruptures or develops a serious leak, the 
escaping water may flash off as steam.  There will be a serious risk of scalding (to personnel 
attempting to approach isolating valves) and clouds of steam may tend to obscure the area.  
 
1. Close down the boilers. 
2. Maintain operation of the pressurisation unit (to add cold water). 
3. Keep the system c irculating pumps runn ing and main tain the co ld feed supply from 
the pressurisation unit to cool the system as quickly a s possible (there is a risk that 
the pumps may run dry, therefore, shut down the pumps as soon as possible). 
4. Close all isolating valves near the leak as soon as they are accessible.

3.1 Emergency Conditions – Continued 
  
WARNING: Following such an inci dent, have the pressurisatio n unit and boiler 
inspected by the manufacturer, or by the Insurers, to ensure that any structural 
damage (caused by the thermal s hock) has not occurred.  It would also be advisable 
on completion of the repair to hydraulically re-test the system.  
 
Electrical Power Failure 
 
If a power failure occurs, first check to establish whether it is an Electricity Board failure, or a 
circuit breaker tripped, or a mai n fuse blown on the  outgoing side of the installation.  If it is 
established that it is an Electricity Board failure, notify the local authority, but only if failure is 
unique to the particular consumer or unplanned.  
 
Irrespective of the cause of the supply failure, establish whether there will be any damage to 
equipment or danger to staff if supply were to be suddenly restored.  
 
If there are any chances of this, isolate at the main and do not switch on again until all 
necessary equipment is isolated.  When the main supply is restored, switch on the isolators 
after warning relevant staff, and having ensure d that equipment about to receive supply will 
not be rendered dangerous.  
 
The same procedure should be adopted if supply failure is caused by a fault on the outgoing 
side of the installation, but the amount of isolation required will need to be adjusted to relate 
to the extent of the supply failure.  
 
Upon restoration of electrical supply following a fault or an Electricity Board's power failure, 
ensure that all circuit bre akers and starters etc., which "drop out" owing to low voltage and 
require manual re-setting, are re-set.  
 
Refrigerant Leaks 
 
In the event of a refrigerant leak, take the following action:  
 
1. Shut down and electrically isolate the affected refrigeration plant. 
2. Evacuate all personnel from the area local to the leak and call -in specialist 
assistance from a reputable Refrigeration Company. 
3. Ensure that all doors to the rooms are closed and that all smoking is prohibited. 
 
NOTE: The refrigerant that leaks out wi ll most likely be in the form of vapour and, therefore 
the source of leak  will be di fficult to locate without proper leak detection equipment.  The 
refrigerants used are R410A and R407C  which a re virtually non -toxic, however, these 
vapours will break down under heat to form toxic gases. 
 
The outstanding characteristic of these refrigerants is the small hazard to life and property in 
case of leakage. Major alarm or tendency to panic should be avoided.  When repairs a re 
carried out it is advisable to make sure the space is well ventilated.  
 
Every care should be taken to avoid leaks and ensu re the safe disposal of re frigerants to 
avoid environmental damage to the ozone layer.

3.1 Emergency Conditions – Continued 
 
Failure of Water Supply 
 
1. Inform local Water Board immediately failure is noticed. 
2. Inform local Fire Brigade if lack of water supply is expected to last for more than 
several days. 
3. Endeavour to conserve water by limiting non -essential usage.  Inform all staff of 
water failure, stressing the need to conserve available storage supplies. 
4. Keep a careful watch on the level of water within  all storage tanks .  Close the main 
cold water service isolation valve when the water level reaches a point approximately 
2-3” above the feed pipe connection. 
5. The cold-water booster set should NOT be shut down unless the cold-water storage 
tank water level reaches a "LOW WATER" level condition. 
6. Shut down all heating and chilled water pressurisation units. 
 
Note: Safety devices are fitted in the way of float switches, to both tanks that will ensure the 
associated booster pumps do not run under low water conditions.  
 
Excessive Pressure Build up  
 
In the event of excessive pressure build up at the boiler, and of the pressurised closed-circuit 
water system or water booster sets:  
 
1. Shut down the plants heat source, the burners in the case of the boiler, the 
pressurisation unit in  the case of a sealed system and the booster pump set in the 
case of the water supply system.  This action will immediately start to ch eck the 
pressure rise. 
2. Open valves between the plant or system. 
3. Ascertain reason for pressure rise by checking the following: 
a. Manufacturer’s fault-finding charts (where applicable). 
b. Safety valve operation. 
c. Running of pumps. 
d. Pressure switch cut outs. 
e. If expansion vessels are charged and operating satisfactorily. 
f. Water supplies are available. 
4. Bring plant into operation when th e cause of the pressure rise is found, understood 
and remedied. 
 
Fire 
 
Follow procedures laid down by the buildings “FIRE STRATEGY”.  
 
In the event of fire breaking out:  
 
1. Under most conditions occurrence of fire will be picked up by the automatic fire 
detection equipment.  However, to be certain, the manual "break glass" fire alarms 
should be activated. 
2. Having asce rtained the fire locati on, check its severity and if local, contain using 
firefighting equipment provided, e.g. hand extinguishers, fire hose reels etc. 
3. If the fire cannot be checked within a few minutes , Automatic activation/ call point 
alerts switchboard, switchboard alert fire response team and fire brigade so that they 
are ready to mobilise is required. Fire response team attend and investigate, will 
either stand down via switchboard and give a reason, if a confirmed switchboard 
would be alerted and brigade would attend.

3.8 Dry Risers 
 
Dry rising mains are intended for use by the fire brigade or other trained personnel. 
 
A dry riser system is a specialized fire protection system designed to facilitate the delivery of 
water to uppe r floors  quickly and ef ficiently during fire emerge ncies. The term "d ry riser" 
refers to the absence of water in the vertical pipes when they are not in use, in cont rast to a 
"wet riser" system, which contains water at all times. 
 
During a f ire incident, firefighters can connect  their water supply to the inlet connection on 
the ground floor. This pressurizes the dry riser system, allowing water to flow up the riser 
pipes. They can then access the appropriate landing valve on the req uired floor and open it, 
enabling water to be discharged through the outlet connections. 
 
 
  
 
Dry riser inlet on build

4.0 OVERVIEW OF THE BUILDING AND ITS ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGY 
 
4.1 Natural Light  
 
Daylight has many adv antages over artificial light - not least the fact that it is a completely 
free, unlimited natural resource. Whilst artificial light is  essential, its provisi on uses a lo t of 
energy, so reducing the requirement will dramatically cut energy use, and the CO2 emissions 
which result from this. 
 
General Areas (excluding Atrium)  
Shading provided by the external louvres, blinds  are provided to mitigate the risk of 
excessive solar gain, on particularly hot days, or, when the sun is at its lowest in the sky.

4.2 Natural Ventilation  
 
In non-patient areas, which comprise of office accommodatio n and Sitting Room (64.0.019), 
Atrium (64.0.002), A natural ventilation st rategy has been employed to ensure compliance 
with CIBSE TM52.  
 
These spaces, with dir ect access to external walls, re ly on a natural ventilation strategy to 
ensure comfortable room conditions. Openable windows provide the natural v entilation 
required to offset heat gains in the summer months and reduce temperatures within the 
space to achieve the overheating criteria. 
 
General Areas (excluding Atrium)  
To achieve the required openable window area, generally the windows open inwa rd and are 
not restricted t o 100mm clear opening (with the exception of the windows within transient 
spaces not in cluded in the overheati ng assess ment ie. stair cores). Louvred blades, 
providing at le ast 90% op enable area are fixed externally to provide suitab le security and 
safety due to the increase openable window area.  
 
In addition to the shading provided by the ex ternal louvres, blinds are provided to mitigate 
the risk of excessive sol ar gain, on particularly hot days, or, when the sun is at its lowes t in 
the sky.  
 
In some ins tances, additional passive ventilation is provided via roof mounted windcatcher 
units. These consist of thermally insulated shutoff damper, weather sensor and lin ked to the 
BMS.  
 
 
  
  
 
Windcatchers 
 
Windcatcher wall mounted 
controller 
 
Manual Teleflex control 
 
The associated actuator for each roof terminal is ma de accessible from within th e room and 
linked back to the BMS via a dedicated windcatcher controller located i n the local electrical 
riser cupboard. A local override to  open/close the damper is provided within the occupied 
space to provide local control to each roof terminal. This override also responds to the space 
temperature & CO 2 levels to automatically open i f the space  conditions dictate. Each 
Penthouse Louvre is provided with an acoustic splitter to attenuate any external noise from 
plant items located adjacent.   
 
The Sitting Room (64.0.019) derogates away from the NHS Heatwave Guidance due to the 
clinical request to have  a relationship with outside with large openable windows and doors. 
Vulnerable patients can find cooler environments to s it and wait within the Waiting  Area or 
Quiet Room spaces.

4.3 Thermal Enhanced Windows 
 
Heat loss is normally measured by the thermal transmittance or U value, usually expressed 
in W/m2K an d, in  its most basic  terms, the l ower th e U value, th e g reater the thermal 
insulation.  However, the amount of free heat energy from the sun, the solar gain or g-value 
can also have a big impact. Window Energy Ratings, which take account of solar gain, were 
introduced by the British Fenestration Rating Council (BFRC) in 2006 and they can provide a 
good indicator of how  energy-efficient win dows can be.  The  Window Energ y Rat ings 
Scheme is based on a scale of A through to G, with A-rated windows being the most energy-
efficient.  Thermally in sulated glass units incorporate low-emissivity glass  such and can 
significantly improve the over all thermal performance of a  window. Therefore, the th ermal 
insulation value is go od indicator of how much energy  can be saved using these types of  
glazing systems. 
 
Users should be aware that covering the glass during winter months will reduce the amount 
of irra diated heat from sunlight and therefore have a negative effect on the solar gain (g-
value). During summer months, the us e of window blinds c an dr amatically assi st i n the 
cooling of of fice and comm unal area s by  reducing the amount of sun light enterin g t he 
building. This in turn  means that th ere is a red uced demand on the buildings heating and 
cooling systems, ultimately saving on energy consumption.

4.4 Photovoltaic System  
 
A Photovoltaic system, also known as a solar power system, or PV system, has been 
installed on the south-east facing roof slope of the office building in order to provide electrical 
power and reduce the building’s carbon footprint.  
 
There are three arrays split over separate roof areas (North Oncology, South Oncolo gy and 
Second Floor Oncology), all connected back to 2 No. inverters within the Second Floor CHW 
Plant Room. 
 
It consists of an arrangement of several components, including a solar panel array to absorb 
and convert sunlight into electricity, a solar inverter to change the electric current from DC to 
AC, as well as mounting, cabl ing and oth er electri cal accessories to set up a working 
system.  
 
The PV panel arrays collec t and convert solar energy to generate electricity, which once 
converted to AC is automat ically supplied to the inverter that then directs to the main switch 
for use within the building. 
 
The 3-phase inverters AC isolators and DC i solators are mounted inside t he second floor 
CHW plant room  (64.2.082), and connected directly to the  Main Panel (second floor LV 
switch room, 64.2.078) via an isolator. 
 
 
  
 
Solar PV array on roof plant area 
 
PV inverter and isolator in level 2 plantroom   
 
To maximise the reduction in emissions through onsite renewables, the maximum area 
available to install PVs on the roof has been utilised. The energy yield of the photovo ltaic 
array has been calculated based on high efficiency panels,  covering all available roof area 
(290m2). This energy yield is capable of reducing the carbon emissions of the building by 
10.6% compared to the non -renewables’ scenario. It also results in a 7.5% reduction from 
the BTER.

4.5 Averting Legionella  
 
Legionellosis is the collective name given to the pneumonia-like illness caused by Legionella 
bacteria. This includes the most serious Legionnaires’ disease, as well as the similar but less 
serious con ditions of P ontiac fever and Lochgoilhead feve r. Legionnaires’ disease is a 
potentially fatal fo rm of pneumonia and e veryone is sus ceptible to in fection. The bacterium 
Legionella pneumophilia and related bacteria are common in natural w ater sources such as 
rivers, lakes and reservoirs, but usually in low numbers. They may also be found in purpose-
built water systems such as cooling towers, evaporative condensers and whirlpool spas. 
 
If c onditions are fav ourable, the b acteria may grow inc reasing the risks of  
Legionnaires’ disease.  
 
Legionella bacteria are widespread in natural wate r system s, e.g. rive rs an d po nds. 
However, the conditions are rarely right for people to catch the disease from these sources. 
Outbreaks of the illness occur fr om exposure to legionella growing in purpose-built systems 
where water is m aintained at a temper ature high enough to encourage growth, e.g. cooling 
towers, evaporati ve condense rs, spa pools, and hot water systems used in a ll so rts of 
premises (work and domestic). 
People can catch Legionnaires’ disease by inhaling small d roplets of water, suspended in  
the air , containing the bacteria. Certai n conditions i ncrease the ri sk from Legionella, 
including these conditions: 
 
• water temperature between 20-45 °C, which is suitable for growth 
• creating and spreading breathable droplets of water, e.g. aerosol created  by a 
cooling tower, or water outlets 
• stored and/or re-circulated water 
• a source of nutrients for the organism e.g. presence of sludge, scale or fouling 
 
Duties under t he Health an d Safety at Work Act 1974  (HSWA) extend to ris ks from 
Legionella bacteria, which may arise from work activities. The Management of Health and 
Safety at Work Regulations (MHSWR) provide a broad framework for controlling health and 
safety at w ork and more sp ecifically t he Control of  Substances Hazardous to Health 
Regulations 2002 (C OSHH) provide a fram ework of duties desig ned to assess,  prevent or 
control the risk from bacteria like Legionella and take suitable precautions. 
 
Identify and Assess Sources of Risk 
 
Carrying out a risk assessment is your responsibility. You may be competent to carry out the 
assessment yourself b ut, if not, yo u should call on help and  advice from ei ther within your 
own organisation or from outside sources, e.g. consultancies.

4.5  Averting Legionella – Continued  
 
You or the person responsible for managing risks , need to understand your water systems, 
the equipment associated with the system such a s pumps, heat ex changers, showers etc., 
and its constituent parts. Identify whether they are likely to create a risk from exposure to 
legionella, and whether: 
 
• water is stored or re-circulated as part of your system 
• the water temperature in all or some parts of the system is between 20-45 °C 
• there are sources of nutrients such as rust, sludge, scale and organic matters 
• the conditions are likely to encourage bacteria to multiply 
• it is po ssible for water droplets to b e produced and , if so, wh ether they can be  
dispersed over a wide area, e.g. showers and aerosols from cooling towers 
• it is likely that any of your employees, residents, visitors etc. are more susceptible to 
infection due to ag e, ill ness, a we akened immune system etc. an d whether t hey 
could be exposed to any contaminated water droplets 
 
Your risk assessment should include: 
 
• management re sponsibilities, i ncluding the name of  the compe tent per son and a 
description of your system 
• any potential risk sources 
• any controls currently in place to control risks 
• monitoring, inspection and maintenance procedures 
• records of the monitoring results and inspection and checks carried out 
• a review date 
 
If you decide that the risks are insignificant and are being properly managed to comply with 
the law, your assessment is complete. You will not need to take any further action, but it is 
important to review your assessment periodically in case anything changes in your system. 
 
Preventing or Controlling the Risk 
 
You should consi der whether yo u can preve nt the risk of Legionella in the first place b y 
looking at the type of water system you need, e.g. identify whether it is possible to replace a 
wet cool ing tower with a dry air -cooled s ystem. The key p oint i s to design, maintain an d 
operate your water services under condit ions that prevent or ade quately control the growth 
and multiplication of Legionella. 
 
If you identify a r isk that you are unable to prevent, you m ust introduce a course  of action 
that will help y ou to  manage the ri sk from legion ella by imp lementing effecti ve c ontrol 
measures, by describing: 
 
• your system, e.g. develop a written schematic 
• who is responsible for carrying out the assessment and managing its implementation 
• the safe and correct operation of your system 
• what control methods and other precautions you will be using 
• what checks will be carried out, and how often will they be carried out, to ensure the 
controls remain effective

6.4 Hard Landscaping Maintenance 
 
The area surrounding the new building is a mixture of standard/hazard warning paving slabs, 
half battered kerbs, brick low-level walls, decorative paving slabs, seats and planters. Some 
general information and guidance on maintenance considerations has been provided below; 
 
All work should be undertaken in compliance with current health and safety legislation. 
 
 
  
 
Concrete 
No regular maintenance of concrete surfacing is required. 
 
Lugano Concrete Block Paving  
Information and guidance addressing safety issues associated with this industry sector, such 
as handling and cutting, can be downloaded (free of charge) from the following website: 
www.paving.org.uk 
 
The appropriate corrective action can be planned and  undertaken as necessary. 
Maintenance and repair work should be categorised into two groups: 
 
• The first involves th e maintenance and repair of the surface,  such as clean ing, re-
filling and compaction of the joint aggregate. 
• The second covers repair of the base structure below the surfacing and re-installation 
of the paving surfacing. 
 
In order to maintain the permeability of the surface, it must be kept cleaned periodically 
using a pressure washer or a sweeper fitted with water jetting and vacuuming equipment. 
 
Hard Surface Elements – General Cleaning Methods 
The simplest way is to scrub the area with soapy water. Use w ashing-up liquid or an acid -
free soap-based floor clea ning product. The soapy water is swilled onto the surface of the 
paving and then brushed with a bristle brush to loosen the surface detrit us.  Wash off the 
loosened dirt with clean water, ensuring all the soap has been thoroughly washed from the 
surface. Carefully channel the resulting run -off to either drainage points or containe rs where 
it can be safely disposed of.  If a power hose is used then care must be taken to avoid the 
removal of the jointing m aterial (sand or mortar). After completion the pavemen t should be 
inspected and the jointing material replaced as required.

6.4 Hard Landscaping Maintenance – Continued  
 
Drainage (ACO Multidrain/Raindrain) 
Periodically (twice yearly is advised, with one occasion prior to leaf fall), lift external manhole 
covers to check for water flows and signs of debris. Inspect the brickwork fo r cracks and the 
integrity of the drainage pipe work running through the manholes.  
 
Check manhole covers and rodding eyes for physical damage.  
 
The manhole covers should be lifte d every six months and greased before replacement to 
allow ease of lifting if required at any other time.  
 
Should blockages occur they sh ould be cleared by rodding from the up -stream manhole to 
evaluate cause of blockage.  
 
In cases of severe blockage, a specialist drain clearing / cleaning contractor should be 
employed. Petrol interceptor should be checked biannually, the alarm system should also be 
checked.  
 
Should any cracks be found in the brickwor k of t he manholes the joints should be chipped 
out and re-pointed. Severe cracking should be referred to a structural engineer for advice.  
Damaged manhole covers or rodding eye covers should be replaced.

8.0 REFIT / REARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION 
 
Due t o th e fixed po sition of the pow er a nd data o utlets, there ar e limitations for furniture 
layout changes. When changes are made to the layout of fur niture/fixtures within the hotel, 
consideration should be tak en not to block window s, walkways, fire escape routes etc. as 
this would cause an  adverse eff ect with re spect to the  buildings lighting, ac cess and 
emergency escape features. 
 
Fire and Life Safety 
The compartment lines and escapes routes are contained within the As Built drawings, and 
should be taken as fixed when considering alterations. Works which alter, or move , these 
conditions will r equire the proposals to  be c hecked a gainst t he buildings emergency  
preparedness model, a long w ith r ecalculating compartm ent size s, and escapes routes, 
together with considering any impact on the ventilation systems and controls. 
 
Ventilation 
Alterations to room sizes should be considered carefully, and checked against the available 
air intake from the windows, doors and wind stack supply to ensure that the designed fresh 
air strategy of the building is maintained. 
 
Day Lighting 
Any al terations to r ooms will  require the day lighti ng factor t o be rec alculated to ensure 
design criterion is maintained. 
 
Occupancy 
The support functions of the building i.e. toilets etc., h ave been siz ed to accommodate the 
buildings maximum occupancy with a contingency of 10%, any increase in numbers over this 
will require the provision of additional toilets. 
 
External Alterations 
Care sho uld be t aken when carrying out extern al al terations to maintain t he air t ightness 
membrane / line of the building and that insulation and  products used are compatible with 
those installed and achieve the same performances. 
Refit materials should be sourced from local suppliers (within a 30-mile radius) and should 
be manufactured from gr een and/or recycled m aterials. Carb on g enerated from va rious 
deliveries to site as well as daily commutes to site during refit works should be offset through 
investment in carbon reduction programmes, to achieve carbon neutrality.

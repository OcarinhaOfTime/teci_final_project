Circuits for cleaner’s supplies are a \\nring arrangement on a dedicated cleaner’s circuit to min imise the risk of disruption to core \\nhospital activities.  \\n \\nFinal circuits incorporating socket ou tlets are generally supplied via single pole combine d \\nResidual curr ent devi ces with overload protection (RCBOs) installed in the di stribution \\nboards. The rating of RCBOs does not exceed 30mA for residual currents.  \\n \\nFor specialist workshop areas on Second Floor, power is fed through a contactor and \\nemergency push button arrange ment. This allows a rooms power to be shut  off by an \\noccupier in an emergency.   \\n \\nA separate computer circuit is provided to areas with emergency stop buttons which  is not \\naffected by the operation of the emergency stop system. Electrical supplies  to fume \\ncupboard ventilation and control are not stopped by activation of the emergency stop.   \\n \\n2 No. BS4343 sockets are provided per IT cabinet for IT cabinet power use. The circuits are \\nsupplied from the dedicated local DB within the IT Hub Room and incorporate RCBO \\nprotection. \\n \\nShowers  \\nA fused connection unit has been installed for each s hower mixing valve, the fuse \\nconnection unit is installed above the ceiling within the shower room.  \\n \\nElectrically Operated Doors  \\nA 13A FCU has been provided for each electrically operated door.

       "  'BUILDING USER GUIDE – TECHNICAL USER \\nRoyal United Hospitals, Dyson Cancer Centre, Bath \\n© 2023 Riddell Project Management – Rev 2 (09.02.24) \\n2.1 Incoming Electrical Services & LV Distribution – Continued  \\n \\nLV Distribution \\nThe new Cancer Centre Building  is provided w ith two Main LV Switchboards, A & B, \\nsupplied by the respective A and B incoming m ain supplies. The switchboards are floor \\nstanding cubicle type switchboards each located in their ow n room to provide physical \\ndamage and fire resilience. The installation i ncludes Power factor correction and Surge \\nProtection as indicated on the As Installed schematic drawing.   \\n \\nThe new switchboards prov ide sub -main distribution throughout the building to plant, \\nMCCP’s, lifts and Distribution boards as necessary.   \\n \\nDistribution Boards  \\nDistribution Boards are generally of the side -by-side sp lit type so tha t lighting and power \\ncircuits are derived from separate parts of the distribution board and the energy consumption \\nof each section can be monitored. Each lighting and power  section includes a dedicated \\nisolating device and sub-metering linked to the BMS sy stem. Final circuit protective devices \\nare Miniat ure Circuit Breakers (MCB) or residual  current cir cuit breaker with overload \\nprotection (RCBO) in accordance with BS 7671 and the HTM’s. \\n \\nMetering is provided in accordance with the contract document and project BREEAM  \\nrequirements. Generally, distribution boards are of split -load type, with power and lighting \\nsegments separately monitored via digital multi -function meters. Bu lk- load supplies to \\nMechanical equipment and other major equipment is metered at the switchgear it is supplied \\nfrom. All meters are digital and are connected to the BMS for remote mo nitoring and \\nrecording of energy consumption.  \\n \\nDistribution / sub-main ca bles are armoured multicore thermosetting cables LS0H to \\nBS5467. Items of critical/ life safety equipment, such as fir e safety and al arm systems, are \\nwired in armoured multicore fire-resistant cables to BS9999 and BS8519. Final circuit \\ncabling consists of LS0H singles cabling installed within steel trunking/conduit.  \\n \\nMain LV Switchboard  \\nThe Main LV Switchboards are located in the dedi cated LV Switchrooms located at Second \\nFloor level. The LV distribution system ensures that loads requiring resil ience in their supply \\nare supplied via A and B submains, terminating in manual selection / aut omatic changeover \\nconnector panels  located adjace nt the equipment supply  termination. Separate lift  \\npanelboards (A&B) are installed within each of the respective switch rooms. \\n \\n \\nPower Factor Correction / Surge Protection  \\nA central power factor correction system has been provided, controlled by an integr al PFC \\nsequencing relay. The power factor correcti on system disconne cts insta ntaneously \\nwhenever the mains fails.  \\n \\nPower factor correction automatically controls power factor to 0.95.  \\n \\nPower factor correction equipment is mounted in a sepa rate cubicle forming an integral part \\nof the switchgear panel;  \\n \\nPower factor correction is in steps of 50kVar.

       "  'WSP Building Services Specification\\n70051669\\nLV Distribution\\nThe New Oncology building shall be provided with fully rated A and B main LV supplies\\nderived from the new local substation. Both the A and B supplies shall be capable of\\nsupporting the whole building load if necessary, but under normal conditions the building\\nload shall be split across both A and B supplies as indicated on the electrical schematic\\ndrawing.\\nThe new Oncology building shall be provided with two Main LV Switchboards, A & B,\\nsupplied by the respective A and B incoming main supplies. The switchboards shall be\\nfloorstanding cubicle type switchboards each located in their own room to provide physical\\ndamage and fire resilience. The installation including Power factor correction and Surge\\nProtection shall be provided as indicated on the schematic drawing and within the relevant\\nsections of this document.\\nThe new  switchboards shall provide sub-main distribution throughout the building to plant,\\nMCCP’s, lifts and Distribution boards as necessary. The switchboards shall be constructed\\nwith a protection separation level of Form 4 Type 6, IP31 in construction, metal clad with\\ncable intake access from the top. The bus bars shall be rated at the full design current and\\nbe suitable for a fault level of 36kA for 1 second and shall comprise outgoing moulded case\\ncircuit breakers, all as indicated on the electrical schematic drawings. The panel shall be\\nfloor mounted and front access type. The Main LV Switchboard shall be made up of type-\\ntested assemblies.\\nDistribution Boards shall generally be of the side-by-side spit type so that lighting and power\\ncircuits are derived from separate parts of the distribution board and the energy\\nconsumption of each section can be monitored. Each lighting and power section shall\\ninclude a dedicated isolating device and sub-metering linked to the BMS system. Final\\ncircuit protective devices will be Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCB) or residual-current circuit\\nbreaker with overload protection (RCBO) in accordance with BS 7671 and the HTM’s.\\nIn medical locations group 1 and 2 areas, where RCDs are required only type A or type B\\nwill be used.\\nMetering shall be provided in accordance with recommendations of the building regulations\\napproved documents and TM39. Generally, distribution boards shall be of split-load type,\\nwith power and lighting segments separately monitored via digital multi-function meters.\\nBulk-load supplies to Mechanical equipment and other major equipment shall be metered at\\nthe switchgear it is supplied from. All meters shall be digital have suitable outputs to allow\\nfor remote monitoring and recording of measured parameters via the BMS. The final circuit\\ndistribution boards will incorporate 20% future spare capacity in terms of load capacity and\\nspace for additional breakers.\\nThe installation shall be as indicated on the electrical schematic.\\nDistribution / sub-main cables are to be armoured multicore thermosetting cables LS0H to\\nBS5467. Items of critical/life safety equipment, such as fire safety & alarm systems, are to\\nbe wired in armoured multicore fire resistant cables to BS9999 and BS8519. Final circuit\\ncabling is to consist of LS0H singles cabling installed within steel trunking/conduit.\\nThe electrical distribution system, includes the mains and sub-mains distribution to serve\\nthe complete building requirements.

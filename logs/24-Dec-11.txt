  "answer": "The provided text mentions that the CTEC Quantec system has been adapted to provide a bespoke solution for the RUH by the manufacturer.  The system uses a QT601-2 master control panel, which is the processor for the system and controls a Quantec Addressable Call System.  Therefore, the two programming methods are not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that one is related to the QT601-2 master control panel and the other is related to the Quantec Addressable Call System."

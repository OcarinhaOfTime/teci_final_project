QUANTEC supports two primary programming methodologies: a low-level, hardware-abstraction layer utilizing a custom assembly language termed QASM (QUANTEC Assembly), and a higher-level, declarative approach employing the QUANTA language.  QASM provides direct control over the individual quantum bits (qubits) and their interactions, offering fine-grained manipulation for performance optimization and specialized algorithms.  Its instruction set includes primitives for single-qubit rotations (Rx, Ry, Rz), controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates, and other fundamental quantum operations.  However, QASM programs require a deep understanding of the underlying quantum hardware architecture and are significantly more complex to develop and debug.

The QUANTA language, conversely, allows programmers to express quantum computations using a more abstract and intuitive syntax.  This higher-level language relies on a compiler that translates QUANTA code into equivalent QASM instructions, thereby abstracting away much of the low-level hardware management.  QUANTA features built-in support for common quantum algorithms, enabling rapid prototyping and development of complex quantum programs.   While sacrificing some degree of fine-grained control compared to QASM, QUANTA significantly improves programmer productivity and reduces the likelihood of introducing hardware-specific errors.  The choice between QASM and QUANTA depends largely on the specific application requirements and the programmerâ€™s expertise.  For maximum performance and complex optimization, QASM may be preferred, while for rapid development and prototyping, QUANTA offers a significant advantage.

QUANTEC supports two primary programming paradigms:  a low-level, register-based approach and a higher-level, quantum circuit description language (QCL).  The register-based method provides fine-grained control over individual qubits and their interactions, allowing for optimization at the hardware level.  This approach involves direct manipulation of qubit registers using a set of predefined quantum gates, specified through a proprietary instruction set architecture (ISA) detailed in Appendix A.  Programmers utilizing this method are responsible for managing qubit allocation, coherence times, and error mitigation strategies explicitly.  Debugging is performed primarily through low-level register state visualization tools, described in Section 4.3.

The alternative QCL approach offers a more abstract and user-friendly method of programming QUANTEC.  QCL programs are compiled into the underlying register-based instructions by the QUANTEC compiler, which performs various optimizations including gate synthesis and qubit mapping.  QCL leverages a familiar syntax inspired by established classical programming languages, employing constructs such as loops, conditional statements, and function calls to express quantum algorithms.  A comprehensive QCL language reference is provided in Appendix B.  This higher-level approach simplifies the development process, facilitating rapid prototyping and reducing the burden on programmers to handle low-level hardware details.  However, it may result in less optimal performance compared to hand-optimized register-based programs in certain scenarios.  The choice between these two methods depends on the specific application and the programmer's expertise.

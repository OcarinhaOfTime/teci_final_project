SE8300 Programming
Programming with Lua
The SE8300 Room Controllers are programmable using the open programming language Lua. Although building 
management systems often use open protocols and standards, their program BACnet objects and scripting features remain 
proprietary and incompatible with third party devices. The SE8300’s use of an open language enables operability with all 
systems.
Programming with BMS Integration
When integrated into a BACnet MS/TP building management system, the SE8300 offers 10 Program BACnet objects able to 
contain 480 characters each. No special software, license or tool is required.
Programming without Integration
When there is no BACnet MS/TP or Modbus integration, a Lua script can be uploaded directly into the SE8300 unit using the 
SE8000 Uploader Tool. Unlike the 10 PG objects used when the unit is integrated via BACnet MS/TP or Modbus, there is only 
one script, which can contain up to 80kBytes. In addition to Lua scripts, standby screen images and firmware upgrades can 
also be loaded into the SE8300 using the SE8000 Uploader Tool.
HVAC Applications and Beyond
Programming can be used to go beyond the pre-configured control sequences of the SE8300 to create customized HVAC 
applications. It can also be used to comply with specific project requirements and manage other applications, such as 
lighting and other equipment. Using Lua scripts also enables you to take advantage of the extra inputs and outputs of the 
SE8300 to manage other devices, such as sensors and relays.

Open buildingprotocol support
One of the cornerstones of SmartStruxuresolution is
support for open standards. AS-Pcan natively
communicatewiththree ofthemost popular standards
forbuildings: BACnet, LonWorks, andModbus.
Native BACnet support
AS-Pcommunicates directly to BACnet/IPandBACnet
MS/TPnetworks.AS-P provides access toanextensive
range of BACnet devices fromSchneider Electric and
othervendors.
Native LonWorks support
AS-Phas a built-in FTT-10 port to communicate tothe
TP/FT-10 LonWorks network. Integrated LonWorks
functionality enables access to LonWorks devices from
SchneiderElectric andothervendors. LonWorks
networks canbecommissioned, bound, and
configuredfromAS-Pusingthe built-in LonWorks
Network ManagementTool. No third-party tools are
needed. A protocolanalyzerwithpowerful debugging
andnetwork quality monitoringfeatures can be
achievedusingthird-party software, without additional
hardware needed. Toincrease ease of use, LNSdevice
plug-ins aresupported. This allows foreasier
engineeringandmaintenanceof LonWorks devices
from SchneiderElectric andothervendors. There are
some limitations on howLNSdeviceplug-ins can be
used.
Native Modbus support
AS-Pnatively integrates Modbus RS-485 master and
slave configurations,as wellas TCPclient andserver.
This allows full access tothird-party products andthe
range of SchneiderElectricproducts that communicate
on the Modbus protocol, such as powermeters, UPS,
circuit breakers, andlightingcontrollers.
Additional buildingprotocol support
AS-Palsosupports integration andcommunication with
SchneiderElectric supplied BMSsystems anddevices
thatuse the followingstandards forbuildings: I/NET,
MicroNet, andNETWORK8000.
WebServices support
AS-Psupports theuseof WebServices basedonopen
standards,suchas SOAP andREST, to consume data
into the SmartStruxuresolution. Useincoming third-
party data(temperatureforecast,energy cost)overthe
Webto determine sitemodes, scheduling, and
programming.
EcoStruxureWebServices support
EcoStruxureWebServices, Schneider Electric’s Web
Services standard, is natively supportedin AS-P.
EcoStruxureWebServices offers extra features
between compliant systems whetherwithin Schneider
Electric orother authorizedsystems. These features
includesystemdirectory browsing, read/write of
currentvalues, alarmreceiptandacknowledgement,
andhistoricaltrendlogdata. EcoStruxure Web
Services is secure. User name andpasswordare
requiredto logon tothesystem.
Scalable customconfigurations
AS-Pandits family of I/O modules were designedto
meet the unique needs of eachinstallation.Depending
on the configuration, each AS-Pcan controlupto464
I/O points. Because power andcommunications are
deliveredalonga common bus,multiplemodules can
bepluggedtogetherwithout tools ina simpleone-step
process usingthebuilt-inconnectors.
Two programmingoptions
Unique totheindustry, AS-Phas bothScript and
FunctionBlock programmingoptions.This flexibility
assures thatthebest programmingmethodcanbe
selectedfor the application.
eMMCmemory for data andbackup
TheSmartStruxure server device has a4 GB eMMC
memory,which is usedforthe server application,
historical data, andbackupstorage. Users can also
manually back upor restore the SmartStruxureserver
device to a storage location on a PCornetwork.
Through the Enterprise Server, users have the ability to
perform scheduledbackups ofassociated
SmartStruxure server device tonetwork storagefor
evengreater levels of protection.
IT friendly
AS-Pcommunicates usingthe networkingstandards.
This makes installations easy, management simple,
andtransactions secure.
SSLCertificates
Communication betweenclients and the SmartStruxure
servers canbe encrypted usingSecure Socket Layer
(SSL 1.0,2.0, 3.0, andTLS1.0). The servers shipwith a
default self-signedcertificate. Commercial Certification
Authority (CA) servercertificates are supportedto lower
the risk ofmalicious informationtechnology attacks.
Useof encryptedcommunication can be enforcedfor
both WorkStationandWebStation access.

usinga variety of protocols. Because of this, mostparts
of the system functionautonomously andcontinue to
run as awholeevenif communication fails or individual
SmartStruxure servers or devices gooffline.
Variety of connectivity options
AS-Phas numerous ports that enable it tocommunicate
witha wide rangeof protocols, devices, andservers.
AS-Phas the followingports:
• Two 10/100 Ethernet ports
• Two RS-485 ports
• One LonWorks TP/FT port
• One built-in I/O bus port
• One USB host port
• One USB device port
Thetwo Ethernetports are connectedtoa built-in
Ethernet switch. Oneport shouldbe connectedtothe
sitenetwork. The other port canbe usedto connect a
singleWorkStation or WebStation, aModbus TCPunit,
ora BACnet/IPdevice, but not anotherSmartStruxure

AS-Pis a powerfuldevice that can act as a standalone
serverandalso controlI/O modules andmonitorand
managefieldbus devices. Ina smallinstallation,the
embeddedAS-Pdeviceacts as a standaloneserver,
mountedwith its I/Omodules in asmallfootprint. In
medium andlarge installations, functionality is
distributedovermultiple SmartStruxureserverdevices
thatcommunicateover TCP/IP.
Communications hub
Capable ofcoordinatingtraffic from above andbelow
its location, AS-Pcan deliver data directly to you orto
otherservers throughout the site. AS-Pcanrun multiple
controlprograms,managelocalI/O, alarms,andusers,
handleschedulingandlogging, andcommunicate
usinga variety of protocols. Because of this, mostparts
of the system functionautonomously andcontinue to
run as awholeevenif communication fails or individual
SmartStruxure servers or devices gooffline.
Variety of connectivity options
AS-Phas numerous ports that enable it tocommunicate
witha wide rangeof protocols, devices, andservers.
AS-Phas the followingports:
• Two 10/100 Ethernet ports
• Two RS-485 ports
• One LonWorks TP/FT port
• One built-in I/O bus port
• One USB host port
• One USB device port
Thetwo Ethernetports are connectedtoa built-in
Ethernet switch. Oneport shouldbe connectedtothe
sitenetwork. The other port canbe usedto connect a
singleWorkStation or WebStation, aModbus TCPunit,
ora BACnet/IPdevice, but not anotherSmartStruxure
server.
TheUSBdeviceport allows youto upgrade and
interact with AS-Pusing Device Administrator. The USB
host portcanbe usedto providepowerand
communications forAD.
Authentication andpermissions
ASmartStruxure solutionprovides a powerful
permissionsystemthat is easy to manage,flexible, and
adapts toallkinds ofsystemsizes. The permission
systemprovides a security levelto the highest
standards.Authentication is done against the built-in
useraccountmanagement systemoragainst Windows
ActiveDirectory Domains.Thebuilt-inaccount
management systemallows anadministrator toset
passwordpolicies that meet stringent CyberSecurity
guidelines. WhenWindows Active Directory is used, the
administrationcosts are lowerbecause users donot
haveto bemanagedinmultipledirectories.
WorkStation/WebStationinterface
Through any client, the userexperience is similar
regardless of which SmartStruxureservertheuser is
loggedonto. Theusercan logdirectly on to AS-Pto

EcoStruxure Panel Server Appendix A: Details of Modbus Functions
Modbus-SL Functions
General Description
The Modbus messaging service provides a client/server communication between
devices connected to a Modbus Serial Line (Modbus-SL) network.
The client/server model is based on four types of messages:
• Modbus Request, the message sent on the network by the client to initiate a
transaction.
• Modbus Indication, the request message received on the server side.
• Modbus Response, the response message sent by the server .
• Modbus Confirmation, the response message received on the client side.
The Modbus messaging services (client/server model) are used for real time
information exchange between:
• T wo device applications.
• Device application and other device.
• HMI/SCADA applications and devices.
• A PC and a device program providing on line services.
On Serial Line, the Modbus Application Data Unit (ADU) encapsulates the
Protocol Data Unit (PDU) adding the server address and a Cyclic Redundancy
Check (CRC). A dedicated header is used on TCP/IP to identify the Modbus
Application Data Unit. It is called the MBAP header (Modbus Application Protocol
header).

WSP Building Services Specification
70051669
Time out control
including key control
Time out control shall allow a lighting installation to switch off,
or dim to a pre-determined level at a pre-determined time.
Manual dimming Manual dimming control shall allow users to easily dim the
lighting within a pre-determined area.
Scene setting Scene setting control shall allow the users of a space to
choose from a pre-determined number of lighting
arrangements.
Colour shifting Control of a colour shifting lighting installation shall allow a
system to automatically adjust the colour temperature of the
light sources to match a pre-determined sequence, typically in
order to mimic the changing colours of daylight through a
dawn to dusk cycle
The control type (or types depending on the complexity of the design) will be stated in the
particular requirements of this specification.
7313003 System types
There are three types of lighting control system:
1. Standalone systems where an independent or integrated detector switches or
dims a luminaire, or group of luminaires independent of any external input or
control.
2. Semi networked systems where a group of luminaires, detectors and switches are
connected via a lighting control module (LCM). LCM’s in semi networked
arrangements are autonomous and operate to a predetermined set of parameters
which can be altered through the local connection of a pc running suitable
software. Semi networked systems shall comply with BS EN 62386 (all associated
parts).
3. Networked systems where detectors, switches and transducers are connected as
data inputs to a central control system via TIA 485 standard interfaces and using
an open protocol control such as DALI or KNX. Control of lighting is then managed
by the control system via outstation relay or contactor switching of circuits.
Networked systems shall be provided with a permanently connected “head end”
computer to allow continuous monitoring of system status and onsite modification
of control protocols.  Networked systems shall comply with BS EN 62386 (all
associated parts).
The system type (or types depending on the complexity of the design) will be stated in the
particular requirements of this specification.
7313004 System protocol
The control system shall be either standalone or networked as indicated in the particular
requirements of this specification. Where a networked system is being utilised, the control
protocol shall be either DALI or KNX. Where existing systems are being expanded, the
existing system protocol shall be used.
7313006 Control software
The lighting control software shall be provided license free and capable of running on the
Microsoft Windows platform. Software shall be capable of the following:
· Complete and autonomous operation of the lighting control system within pre-
defined parameters.
· Capable of accepting and incorporating updates without the need to re-boot.

Open buildingprotocol support
One of the cornerstones of SmartStruxuresolution is
support for open standards. AS-Pcan natively
communicatewiththree ofthemost popular standards
forbuildings: BACnet, LonWorks, andModbus.
Native BACnet support
AS-Pcommunicates directly to BACnet/IPandBACnet
MS/TPnetworks.AS-P provides access toanextensive
range of BACnet devices fromSchneider Electric and
othervendors.
Native LonWorks support
AS-Phas a built-in FTT-10 port to communicate tothe
TP/FT-10 LonWorks network. Integrated LonWorks
functionality enables access to LonWorks devices from
SchneiderElectric andothervendors. LonWorks
networks canbecommissioned, bound, and
configuredfromAS-Pusingthe built-in LonWorks
Network ManagementTool. No third-party tools are
needed. A protocolanalyzerwithpowerful debugging
andnetwork quality monitoringfeatures can be
achievedusingthird-party software, without additional
hardware needed. Toincrease ease of use, LNSdevice
plug-ins aresupported. This allows foreasier
engineeringandmaintenanceof LonWorks devices
from SchneiderElectric andothervendors. There are
some limitations on howLNSdeviceplug-ins can be
used.
Native Modbus support
AS-Pnatively integrates Modbus RS-485 master and
slave configurations,as wellas TCPclient andserver.
This allows full access tothird-party products andthe
range of SchneiderElectricproducts that communicate
on the Modbus protocol, such as powermeters, UPS,
circuit breakers, andlightingcontrollers.
Additional buildingprotocol support
AS-Palsosupports integration andcommunication with
SchneiderElectric supplied BMSsystems anddevices
thatuse the followingstandards forbuildings: I/NET,
MicroNet, andNETWORK8000.
WebServices support
AS-Psupports theuseof WebServices basedonopen
standards,suchas SOAP andREST, to consume data
into the SmartStruxuresolution. Useincoming third-
party data(temperatureforecast,energy cost)overthe
Webto determine sitemodes, scheduling, and
programming.
EcoStruxureWebServices support
EcoStruxureWebServices, Schneider Electric’s Web
Services standard, is natively supportedin AS-P.
EcoStruxureWebServices offers extra features
between compliant systems whetherwithin Schneider
Electric orother authorizedsystems. These features
includesystemdirectory browsing, read/write of
currentvalues, alarmreceiptandacknowledgement,
andhistoricaltrendlogdata. EcoStruxure Web
Services is secure. User name andpasswordare
requiredto logon tothesystem.
Scalable customconfigurations
AS-Pandits family of I/O modules were designedto
meet the unique needs of eachinstallation.Depending
on the configuration, each AS-Pcan controlupto464
I/O points. Because power andcommunications are
deliveredalonga common bus,multiplemodules can
bepluggedtogetherwithout tools ina simpleone-step
process usingthebuilt-inconnectors.
Two programmingoptions
Unique totheindustry, AS-Phas bothScript and
FunctionBlock programmingoptions.This flexibility
assures thatthebest programmingmethodcanbe
selectedfor the application.
eMMCmemory for data andbackup
TheSmartStruxure server device has a4 GB eMMC
memory,which is usedforthe server application,
historical data, andbackupstorage. Users can also
manually back upor restore the SmartStruxureserver
device to a storage location on a PCornetwork.
Through the Enterprise Server, users have the ability to
perform scheduledbackups ofassociated
SmartStruxure server device tonetwork storagefor
evengreater levels of protection.
IT friendly
AS-Pcommunicates usingthe networkingstandards.
This makes installations easy, management simple,
andtransactions secure.
SSLCertificates
Communication betweenclients and the SmartStruxure
servers canbe encrypted usingSecure Socket Layer
(SSL 1.0,2.0, 3.0, andTLS1.0). The servers shipwith a
default self-signedcertificate. Commercial Certification
Authority (CA) servercertificates are supportedto lower
the risk ofmalicious informationtechnology attacks.
Useof encryptedcommunication can be enforcedfor
both WorkStationandWebStation access.

Open buildingprotocol support
One of the cornerstones of SmartStruxuresolution is
support for open standards. AS-Pcan natively
communicatewiththree ofthemost popular standards
forbuildings: BACnet, LonWorks, andModbus.
Native BACnet support
AS-Pcommunicates directly to BACnet/IPandBACnet
MS/TPnetworks.AS-P provides access toanextensive
range of BACnet devices fromSchneider Electric and
othervendors.
Native LonWorks support
AS-Phas a built-in FTT-10 port to communicate tothe
TP/FT-10 LonWorks network. Integrated LonWorks
functionality enables access to LonWorks devices from
SchneiderElectric andothervendors. LonWorks
networks canbecommissioned, bound, and
configuredfromAS-Pusingthe built-in LonWorks
Network ManagementTool. No third-party tools are
needed. A protocolanalyzerwithpowerful debugging
andnetwork quality monitoringfeatures can be
achievedusingthird-party software, without additional
hardware needed. Toincrease ease of use, LNSdevice
plug-ins aresupported. This allows foreasier
engineeringandmaintenanceof LonWorks devices
from SchneiderElectric andothervendors. There are
some limitations on howLNSdeviceplug-ins can be
used.
Native Modbus support
AS-Pnatively integrates Modbus RS-485 master and
slave configurations,as wellas TCPclient andserver.
This allows full access tothird-party products andthe
range of SchneiderElectricproducts that communicate
on the Modbus protocol, such as powermeters, UPS,
circuit breakers, andlightingcontrollers.
Additional buildingprotocol support
AS-Palsosupports integration andcommunication with
SchneiderElectric supplied BMSsystems anddevices
thatuse the followingstandards forbuildings: I/NET,
MicroNet, andNETWORK8000.
WebServices support
AS-Psupports theuseof WebServices basedonopen
standards,suchas SOAP andREST, to consume data
into the SmartStruxuresolution. Useincoming third-
party data(temperatureforecast,energy cost)overthe
Webto determine sitemodes, scheduling, and
programming.
EcoStruxureWebServices support
EcoStruxureWebServices, Schneider Electric’s Web
Services standard, is natively supportedin AS-P.
EcoStruxureWebServices offers extra features

SE8300 Programming
Programming with Lua
The SE8300 Room Controllers are programmable using the open programming language Lua. Although building 
management systems often use open protocols and standards, their program BACnet objects and scripting features remain 
proprietary and incompatible with third party devices. The SE8300’s use of an open language enables operability with all 
systems.
Programming with BMS Integration
When integrated into a BACnet MS/TP building management system, the SE8300 offers 10 Program BACnet objects able to 
contain 480 characters each. No special software, license or tool is required.
Programming without Integration
When there is no BACnet MS/TP or Modbus integration, a Lua script can be uploaded directly into the SE8300 unit using the 
SE8000 Uploader Tool. Unlike the 10 PG objects used when the unit is integrated via BACnet MS/TP or Modbus, there is only 
one script, which can contain up to 80kBytes. In addition to Lua scripts, standby screen images and firmware upgrades can 
also be loaded into the SE8300 using the SE8000 Uploader Tool.
HVAC Applications and Beyond
Programming can be used to go beyond the pre-configured control sequences of the SE8300 to create customized HVAC 
applications. It can also be used to comply with specific project requirements and manage other applications, such as 
lighting and other equipment. Using Lua scripts also enables you to take advantage of the extra inputs and outputs of the 
SE8300 to manage other devices, such as sensors and relays.

Time out control
including key control
Time out control shall allow a lighting installation to switch off,
or dim to a pre-determined level at a pre-determined time.
Manual dimming Manual dimming control shall allow users to easily dim the
lighting within a pre-determined area.
Scene setting Scene setting control shall allow the users of a space to
choose from a pre-determined number of lighting
arrangements.
Colour shifting Control of a colour shifting lighting installation shall allow a
system to automatically adjust the colour temperature of the
light sources to match a pre-determined sequence, typically in
order to mimic the changing colours of daylight through a
dawn to dusk cycle
The control type (or types depending on the complexity of the design) will be stated in the
particular requirements of this specification.
7313003 System types
There are three types of lighting control system:
1. Standalone systems where an independent or integrated detector switches or
dims a luminaire, or group of luminaires independent of any external input or
control.
2. Semi networked systems where a group of luminaires, detectors and switches are
connected via a lighting control module (LCM). LCM’s in semi networked
arrangements are autonomous and operate to a predetermined set of parameters
which can be altered through the local connection of a pc running suitable
software. Semi networked systems shall comply with BS EN 62386 (all associated
parts).
3. Networked systems where detectors, switches and transducers are connected as
data inputs to a central control system via TIA 485 standard interfaces and using
an open protocol control such as DALI or KNX. Control of lighting is then managed
by the control system via outstation relay or contactor switching of circuits.
Networked systems shall be provided with a permanently connected “head end”
computer to allow continuous monitoring of system status and onsite modification
of control protocols.  Networked systems shall comply with BS EN 62386 (all
associated parts).
The system type (or types depending on the complexity of the design) will be stated in the
particular requirements of this specification.
7313004 System protocol
The control system shall be either standalone or networked as indicated in the particular
requirements of this specification. Where a networked system is being utilised, the control
protocol shall be either DALI or KNX. Where existing systems are being expanded, the
existing system protocol shall be used.
7313006 Control software
The lighting control software shall be provided license free and capable of running on the
Microsoft Windows platform. Software shall be capable of the following:
· Complete and autonomous operation of the lighting control system within pre-
defined parameters.
· Capable of accepting and incorporating updates without the need to re-boot.

Royal United Hospitals, Dyson Cancer Centre, Bath 
© 2023 Riddell Project Management – Rev 2 (09.02.24) 
2.4 Staff Attack Alarm 
 
A dedicated staff attack system has been installed. The system is compatible with the 
existing system at the RUH site and is connected to the Facilities Network via the structured 
cabling system.  
 
The staff attack system comprises of: 
 
• Master Controller 
• Corridor Display Units 
• Call Buttons 
• Indicators and Sounders 
• All necessary control equipment, power supplies, cabling and data connections. 
 
The staff attack system is intended to provide a call system to the bui lding that staff can use 
to generate an alert under a duress situation.  
 
The building incorporates two master control panels: 
 
• Panel 1 will run  the CANCER CENTRE building – sited in main entrance lobby 
(64.0.001) 
• Panel 2 (Repeater Panel) – sited in main entrance for radiotherapy (64.0.136) 
 
Each panel is split into sub areas so that it provides its own local alarm. 
 
The system is based upon a CTEC Quantec system that has been adapted to provide a 
bespoke solution for the RUH by the manufacturer.  
 
Master Controller  
The system comprises a QT601-2 master control panel that is the processor for the system 
and has an on-board LCD screen with access a nd programming keys. This supplies power 
to and controls a Quantec Addressable Call System.

Communication Architectures EcoStruxure Panel Server
Separate Ethernet Network
This architecture is recommended for network security:
• This architecture keeps the Ethernet network segregated.
• No IP packet is forwarded between Panel Server ports ETH1 and ETH2.
• Modbus server can be enabled on Panel Server port ETH1 or ETH2.
The following diagram illustrates an architecture with Ethernet port configuration in
separate mode:
• In the case of cloud connection, this architecture allows you to avoid
malicious access to the downstream devices (including Modbus TCP/IP
devices connected on ETH2) by disabling Modbus TCP/IP server on port
ETH1. Cloud connection is done through ETH1 port. In this case Modbus
TCP/IP is disabled on ETH1.
In this case, Modbus TCP/IP server on ETH2 can be disabled.
• In the case of edge software, this architecture allows you to separate
electrical distribution devices from the IT network (LAN) and allows also to
have a single IP address to access the electrical distribution devices. In this
case, Modbus TCP/IP client should be enabled on ETH1 to allow the edge
software to access data within devices connected to ETH2 port. In this case,
Modbus TCP/IP server on ETH2 can be disabled.

Introduction
At the coreof aSmartStruxure solutionis a
SmartStruxure server device, suchas AS-P. AS-P
performs key functionality, suchas control logic, trend
logging, and alarm supervision, andsupports
communicationandconnectivity totheI/O andfield
buses. Thedistributedintelligence of the SmartStruxure
solutionensures fault tolerance in the systemand
provides a fully featureduser interface through
WorkStation andWebStation.
Features
AS-Pis a powerfuldevice that can act as a standalone
serverandalso controlI/O modules andmonitorand
managefieldbus devices. Ina smallinstallation,the
embeddedAS-Pdeviceacts as a standaloneserver,
mountedwith its I/Omodules in asmallfootprint. In
medium andlarge installations, functionality is
distributedovermultiple SmartStruxureserverdevices
thatcommunicateover TCP/IP.
Communications hub
Capable ofcoordinatingtraffic from above andbelow
its location, AS-Pcan deliver data directly to you orto
otherservers throughout the site. AS-Pcanrun multiple
controlprograms,managelocalI/O, alarms,andusers,
handleschedulingandlogging, andcommunicate
usinga variety of protocols. Because of this, mostparts
of the system functionautonomously andcontinue to
run as awholeevenif communication fails or individual
SmartStruxure servers or devices gooffline.
Variety of connectivity options
AS-Phas numerous ports that enable it tocommunicate
witha wide rangeof protocols, devices, andservers.
AS-Phas the followingports:
• Two 10/100 Ethernet ports
• Two RS-485 ports
• One LonWorks TP/FT port
• One built-in I/O bus port
• One USB host port
• One USB device port
Thetwo Ethernetports are connectedtoa built-in
Ethernet switch. Oneport shouldbe connectedtothe
sitenetwork. The other port canbe usedto connect a
singleWorkStation or WebStation, aModbus TCPunit,
ora BACnet/IPdevice, but not anotherSmartStruxure
server.
TheUSBdeviceport allows youto upgrade and
interact with AS-Pusing Device Administrator. The USB
host portcanbe usedto providepowerand
communications forAD.
Authentication andpermissions
ASmartStruxure solutionprovides a powerful
permissionsystemthat is easy to manage,flexible, and
adapts toallkinds ofsystemsizes. The permission
systemprovides a security levelto the highest
standards.Authentication is done against the built-in
useraccountmanagement systemoragainst Windows
ActiveDirectory Domains.Thebuilt-inaccount
management systemallows anadministrator toset
passwordpolicies that meet stringent CyberSecurity
guidelines. WhenWindows Active Directory is used, the
administrationcosts are lowerbecause users donot
haveto bemanagedinmultipledirectories.
WorkStation/WebStationinterface
Through any client, the userexperience is similar
regardless of which SmartStruxureservertheuser is
loggedonto. Theusercan logdirectly on to AS-Pto

Each cabinet shall be fitted with two internal power distribution units (PDU), consisting of
12No single 13A outlets to serve all equipment within the enclosure. PDUs shall be
mounted vertically at the rear of cabinets and be complete with a flexible cable (nominal 2m
length) for connection to an external power supply. Each PDU shall be complete with
integral surge suppression.
Fan trays shall be provided to all cabinets. Each cabinet shall be connected to earth by a
single copper cored cable; with cream LSF insulation. Each cabinet shall be individually
earthed via the metal structure of the cabinet.
Cables entering enclosed panels shall be protected by appropriate protective glands or
grommets. Cabinet details and management layouts shall be agreed with the Client prior to
installation.
Horizontal Wiring (Building Wiring)
Horizontal wiring shall consist of cabling between patch panels and outlet locations. This
wiring shall be supported on steel cable basket routed in risers and horizontally (above
ceilings) following the primary services routes. The cables leaving the baskets shall be
enclosed in 25mm Ø flexible / rigid conduits.
At no point shall communications cables be tied to power cables or run along the same
conduits or ducts, or run through the same connection box.
Internal cable runs in metal enclosed trunking or conduit shall be separated from external
parallel runs of power cables by a minimum of 50mm. All other power and communications
cables shall be separated according to the recommendations stated in CIBSE AM7.
Installed cables shall take the shortest route consistent with the usage of the containment
system and defined routes and shall not, unless specified, contain length in excess of the
distance required.
All cables which cross service pipes carrying hot or refrigerant fluids shall be protected from
excessive high/low temperature or condensation. This may require separation and/or
thermal insulation.
Cables shall be kept clear of heat and smoke detectors and water detection strips.
Each end of each cable shall be uniquely labelled to assist identification of wiring.
Generally, installed cables shall not be subject to vibration or movement. Where
trays/baskets cross building expansion or movement joints, slack shall be left after the last
and first cable ties that secure the cables thereto.
Cables shall not be fixed using staples.
The maximum length of Cat6A cable run shall not exceed 90 metres. If during production of
the working drawings, it seems possible any Cat6A cabling planned to be installed may
exceed 90m, this shall be bought to the attention of the Client before any installation of this
cabling takes place.
Voice and data cables will be installed to the same cable tray/basket/trunking as they are
the same media. They shall be installed to use the minimum of the tray/basket width. Four
pair cables shall not be stacked higher than 50mm on cable tray/basket at any location.
Cables shall leave tray/basket at right angles and shall be suitably cable tied and dressed.
Cables leaving basket systems shall exit through the bottom or side of the basket. Cable
exits shall be strictly controlled such that additional cables can be easily and neatly added
to trays/baskets in the future.
Voice and data cabling shall enter and exiting trunking via bridges to ensure complete
separation between communications and power compartments.
Outlets (UTP)

Design Development Note Page 2 of 6 
The flow of hot water in the pumped system shall be controlled by automatic thermal balance valves, 
installed in the return pipework from each final branch. A fixed thermostatic balancing valve shall be 
installed at the furthest (index) point of each pipe run to provide a constant flow rate through the return 
circuit. 
All wash hand basins shall be provided with (TMV3) thermostatic mixing valves or taps and all showers 
shall be provided with a thermostatic control/ mixing valve to provide independent adjustment of flow 
and temperature. 
All sanitary appliances shall be fitted with either an integral or separat e flow limiting valve to 
automatically limit the flow of hot and cold water in accordance with the BS8558. The Architect shall 
be responsible for stating the flow rate (and flow restrictor flow) to each appliance.  
Pressure reducing valves shall be provide within the final branch flow pipework, directly after the flow 
and return loop system. (where required) in order to prevent excessive water pressures (over 3 bar at 
the outlet) occurring at any location. 
SPECIALIST MEDICAL WATER SUPPLY & EQUIPMENT  
The current design does not include for any specialist medical equipment, the final requirements shall 
be coordinated within the design stages.  
PIPEWORK & FITTINGS 
All mains, boosted cold water services and domestic hot water pipework above ground shall b e in 
copper tube to BS EN 1057 (Table X) with press fit fittings. No flexible connections shall be allowed in 
any part of the domestic cold-water installation. 
All exposed pipework shall be installed using chrome plated copper (compression fittings). Chrom e 
plated copper shall be manufactured to BS EN 1057(5) and BS EN ISO 1456.  
To reduce the risk of any cross contamination any dedicated Cat 5 supplies shall be installed to a 
dissimilar pipework material to that of the domestic hot and cold.  
Full bore Isolation valves shall be provided to all fittings and at the base of all risers on main branches 
and at all final connections to items of sanitary ware and appliances. 
Domestic hot and cold water services pipework within plant areas, ceiling voids and riser ducts, plus 
any external pipework, shall be thermally insulated with phenolic foam. Pipework located in unheated 
areas and/or liable to freeze shall be fitted with automatic self-regulating trace heating. 
To comply with the healthcare standards as a minimu m the domestic pipework distribution system 
shall be provided with  
 Temperature Monitoring Sensors in Both CWS and HW F&R system. – (HTM 0401)

 Refer to Derogation Schedule 
BREEAM 
The design basis for the water services shall meet the requirements of any BREEAM requirements 
imposed on the project. 
WATER SERVICES LOADING UNITS 
All pipework and flow rates throughout the development shall be determined using the Loadin g Units 
method as set out in IOP Guide.

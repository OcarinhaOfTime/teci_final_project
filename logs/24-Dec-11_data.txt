of a motor or other pump component failure. A duplex arrangement enables a faulty pump
to be removed from replacement whilst the remaining unit is in operation. Twin head pump
shall not be used.
A packaged automatic fill and expansion set and expansion vessels shall be installed in
the Level 2 CHW Plantroom and shall be connected across the teritary flow and return
LTHW pipework.
The teritary circuit shall be complete with a duplex strainer and chemical dosing pot to
remove the build up of sludge within the existing service. The dosing pot should allow for
correction of LTHW system water treatment levels without needing to shut the system
down.
LOW TEMPERATURE HOT WATER
The pumped LTHW secondary circuits shall be provided and connected to the low loss
header;
- Circuit 1 shall supply LTHW at constant temperature (CT), variable volume to all
terminal units (radiant panels, FCUs, heater batteries, over door air curtains).
- Circuit 2 shall supply LTHW at constant temperature (CT), variable volume to all
frost and heating coils in air handling units located on each of the 3no. Roof Levels.
- Circuit 3 shall supply LTHW at constant temperature (CT) to the Radiotherapy
LTHW to LTHW plate heat exchanger located in the CHW Plantroom 13.017 on
Level 2.
- Circuit 4 shall supply LTHW at constant temperature (CT) on a teritary level to the
existing Radiotherapy department on Level 0.
The constant temperature (CT) circuits 1, 2 & 3 shall operate at the 82/62°C flow/return
condition to ensure 80/60°C flow/return temperatures are achieved on the tertiary circuit 4
which serves existing Radiotherapy.
It should be noted, that during warmer weather the return temperature from Circuit 1 may
be greater than 62°C. The radiant panels require a minimum flow to enable commissioning,
in some cases this is greater than the required flow to overcome the heat loss in the space.
Subsequently the circuit is operating at a greater flow rate than is required which could
elevate the return water temperature. Therefore circuit 1 pumpset and the primary LTHW
pumpset have been sized to accommodate the minimum flow rate through the radiant
panels, and the duty of the LTHW plate heat exchanger has increased. The steam control
valve on the primary side of the steam plate heat exchanger shall be able to schedule the
flow/return conditions during warmer weather to prevent the elevation of the return water
temperature.
The secondary and teritary heating circuits shall be provided with duplicate variable speed
inverter driven pumps, (not twin head) giving full duty/standby capability and arranged for
automatic changeover on failure of the duty pump.
LTHW heating circuit connections to the AHU heating and frost coils, plate heat exchanger
and FCUs shall include two-port modulating control valves.
The circuits proposed with two-port control valves shall employ a variable flow control
strategy with the pump speed modulated to match the LTHW circuit demand. The pump
speed shall be controlled by the BMS and the pump motors on-board inverter drives via a
signal from the pump mounted differential pressure sensors. The pump speed shall be the
lowest necessary to deliver the amount of LTHW to the system to meet the demands of
the system. Should the pump manufacturer be unable to provide a pump with integral
differential pressure controls, the separate sensors shall be positioned in a location that is
representative of the system dynamics at all flow conditions and shall not be directly
located across the pump suction and discharge connections.
Differential pressure control valves shall be incorporated at the end of the line branch, with
two port control valves in the branch to provide stability of pressure and maintain authority
for the valve. LTHW heating circuits shall be provided with all necessary control, isolation

At the request of the operator, a system summary of all programmed points shall be obtainable,
with status conditions. It shall be possible to obtain summaries for individual systems, of all
systems, displayed on the VDU, and the printer.
All plant interlocking with the exception of safety interlocks shall be achieved through software. In
the case of safety interlocks these shall be carried out via hardwiring and also through software
to prevent mismatch alarms. The interlock chain for each device shall be displayed in a simple
and easily understood format so that the method of control of that device may be understood by
reading the VDU.
The plant start/stop regimes shall ensure that at start up and shut down that a logical order of
start/stop sequence shall be followed. This would include, for example, that pumps are stopped
and started up to ten minutes prior to or following the stop/start of steam plate heat exchangers.
All time controls shall include a 12-month period incorporating all standard holidays, time changes
and leap years.
On start-up of a ventilation system the following shall occur:
- Heating to AHU proven (frost protection)
- Fully open the fresh air inlet damper. Confirm open via limit switch
- Fully open the exhaust damper. Confirm open via limit switch
- Enable supply fan. Confirm air flow via DP switch
- Enable extract fan. Confirm air flow via DP switch
- Activate heat recovery system
- Activate heating/cooling coils
During plant shut down periods, control valves shall be set to the following positions.
- AHU frost coils - remain under automatic control as per Frost Protection Section
- AHU cooling coils - fully closed
- AHU reheat coils - fully closed
- Duct reheat coils - fully closed
- Pump diverting valves – fully closed (heating valves to re-open during frost operation)
A cause and effect procedure shall be developed in collaboration with the Trust to ensure plant
start/stop operation occurs in accordance with the fire evacuation plan. This shall be determined
as part of the pre-commissioning programme and agreed in good time prior to handover.
Optimisation Programme
Optimisation programmes shall be provided for energy conservation and shall calculate the
optimal morning start and evening stop times for the HVAC plant, Based on department
occupancy times, building thermal mass, measured internal space and outside conditions. The
programmes shall be suitable for both heating and cooling systems and shall be ‘self-adaptive’
i.e. they shall make corrections to the programmed characteristics in accordance with the
accuracy of the previous 21 predictions. The programme shall start the plant in a boost condition
that shall be terminated at occupancy time. If desired space temperature is achieved before
occupancy then the heating shall revert to normal control. Cooling shall not be initiated until
occupation time.
The programme shall be written such that the boost period shall only be terminated once per day.
The programme shall also incorporate facilities for maintaining the internal space temperature of
the building above a predetermined minimum level, outside occupancy hours. These settings shall

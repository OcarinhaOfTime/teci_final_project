2.4 Staff Attack Alarm 
 
A dedicated staff attack system has been installed. The system is compatible with the 
existing system at the RUH site and is connected to the Facilities Network via the structured 
cabling system.  
 
The staff attack system comprises of: 
 
• Master Controller 
• Corridor Display Units 
• Call Buttons 
• Indicators and Sounders 
• All necessary control equipment, power supplies, cabling and data connections. 
 
The staff attack system is intended to provide a call system to the bui lding that staff can use 
to generate an alert under a duress situation.  
 
The building incorporates two master control panels: 
 
• Panel 1 will run  the CANCER CENTRE building – sited in main entrance lobby 
(64.0.001) 
• Panel 2 (Repeater Panel) – sited in main entrance for radiotherapy (64.0.136) 
 
Each panel is split into sub areas so that it provides its own local alarm. 
 
The system is based upon a CTEC Quantec system that has been adapted to provide a 
bespoke solution for the RUH by the manufacturer.  
 
Master Controller  
The system comprises a QT601-2 master control panel that is the processor for the system 
and has an on-board LCD screen with access a nd programming keys. This supplies power 
to and controls a Quantec Addressable Call System.

Specific items which require commissioning by specialist employees of the manufacturer
and/or supplier of same have been identified in the particular clauses for these items.
Certain elements of the contract works are required to be tested by the specialist sub-
Electrical Contractors employed for said works. These have been identified in the clauses
relating to said works. However, the Electrical Contractor shall be fully responsible for the
commissioning of the Electrical Contractors installations generally, co-ordinating and
supervising the activities of the other parties described above to achieve a fully
commissioned and co-ordinated installation prior to the date for completion of the Contract.
Within 3 months of starting on site, the Electrical Contractor shall produce for comment and
approval a Commissioning Manual for the works to assist with respect to commissioning
duties and provide a documented record of same.
The manual shall contain the following:
Method Statements for undertaking the commissioning requirements of each service/ sub -
system or equipment item.
A proposed programme for the commissioning identifying weekly activities and time
allowance requirements.
During the commissioning period, the Electrical Contractor shall complete the manuals,
recording activities of same where relevant. All such records shall be witnessed in writing by
the Engineer, and no such record shall be more than seven days old when submitted for
signature. All documentation shall be in accordance with the applicable British Standard,
where appropriate, in a format agreed with the Contract Administrator.
To ensure that RUH Bath Trust has complete commissioning records of all equipment and
installation in their possession at the time of practical completion/handover, a draft copy of
all documents and drawings shall be submitted to the CA for comment at least 4 weeks
prior to the date of practical completion.

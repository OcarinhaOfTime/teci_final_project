2.4 Staff Attack Alarm 
 
A dedicated staff attack system has been installed. The system is compatible with the 
existing system at the RUH site and is connected to the Facilities Network via the structured 
cabling system.  
 
The staff attack system comprises of: 
 
• Master Controller 
• Corridor Display Units 
• Call Buttons 
• Indicators and Sounders 
• All necessary control equipment, power supplies, cabling and data connections. 
 
The staff attack system is intended to provide a call system to the bui lding that staff can use 
to generate an alert under a duress situation.  
 
The building incorporates two master control panels: 
 
• Panel 1 will run  the CANCER CENTRE building – sited in main entrance lobby 
(64.0.001) 
• Panel 2 (Repeater Panel) – sited in main entrance for radiotherapy (64.0.136) 
 
Each panel is split into sub areas so that it provides its own local alarm. 
 
The system is based upon a CTEC Quantec system that has been adapted to provide a 
bespoke solution for the RUH by the manufacturer.  
 
Master Controller  
The system comprises a QT601-2 master control panel that is the processor for the system 
and has an on-board LCD screen with access a nd programming keys. This supplies power 
to and controls a Quantec Addressable Call System.

7313000 Lighting control systems
7313001 General
Comply with the requirements of this and other sections of the specification as well as
associated drawings and schedules.
The lighting control systems shall be provided as shown on the drawings and as specified
elsewhere and shall meet the requirements of recommendations of BS EN 62386 and BRE
Digest 498.
The design is provided at scheme level and detail design along with supply, installation
and commissioning shall be carried out by the contractor. This will allow the design to be
optimised to the contractors preferred control system manufacturer.
7313002 Control types
The table below gives an overview of types of control, related to both energy saving and
scene setting.
Type Description
Absence detection
(Manual ON/Auto
OFF)
Absence detection shall operate by providing the occupier of
a space with a light switch allowing them to switch the lighting
on when they enter a space. The lighting shall then be
switched off automatically when the control system has
detected no movement for a pre-determined period of time
(identified in particular information)
Absence detection may be linked with other control protocols
as identified in particular information.
Presence detection
(Auto On/Auto OFF)
Presence detection shall not require any human interaction to
operate and shall switch on lighting when someone is detected
in the controlled area.  Lighting shall then remain on for a pre-
determined period of time unless further movement is
detected in which case the pre-determined time period shall
begin again.
In large office spaces, presence detection may be linked to
local override manual switching and appropriate zoning to give
more local control and reduced energy use.
Presence detection may be linked with other control protocols
as identified in particular information.
Daylight linking Daylight linking shall reduce or switch off luminaires when the
level of natural light reaches a pre determined threshold.
Daylight linking can be used in connection with presence
detection.
Constant illuminance
adjustment
Constant illuminance adjustment shall allow a luminaire or
group of luminaires to adjust their output over time to allow for
the deterioration of lamp and luminaire through age and build
up of dirt.

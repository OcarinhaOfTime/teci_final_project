        "question": "What is the maximum size of a Lua script that can be uploaded to the SE8300 when it's not integrated with BACnet MS/TP or Modbus?",
        "answer": "80kBytes",
        "context": "Schneider Electric\nMarconi Center\n7262 Marconi\nMontreal, Quebec\nwww.schneider-electric.com\nschneider-electric.com |  4SE8300 Series Room Controller\nSE8300 Programming\nProgramming with Lua\nThe SE8300 Room Controllers are programmable using the open programming language Lua. Although building \nmanagement systems often use open protocols and standards, their program BACnet objects and scripting features remain \nproprietary and incompatible with third party devices. The SE8300\u2019s use of an open language enables operability with all \nsystems.\nProgramming with BMS Integration\nWhen integrated into a BACnet MS/TP building management system, the SE8300 offers 10 Program BACnet objects able to \ncontain 480 characters each. No special software, license or tool is required.\nProgramming without Integration\nWhen there is no BACnet MS/TP or Modbus integration, a Lua script can be uploaded directly into the SE8300 unit using the \nSE8000 Uploader Tool. Unlike the 10 PG objects used when the unit is integrated via BACnet MS/TP or Modbus, there is only \none script, which can contain up to 80kBytes. In addition to Lua scripts, standby screen images and firmware upgrades can \nalso be loaded into the SE8300 using the SE8000 Uploader Tool.\nHVAC Applications and Beyond\nProgramming can be used to go beyond the pre-configured control sequences of the SE8300 to create customized HVAC \napplications. It can also be used to comply with specific project requirements and manage other applications, such as \nlighting and other equipment. Using Lua scripts also enables you to take advantage of the extra inputs and outputs of the \nSE8300 to manage other devices, such as sensors and relays.",
